Sensors - The Backbone of IoT

# Introduction

A device that measure physical properties and converts them into readable data.

## Different types of sensors

Tableau

Sensor | Example |
-------|---------|
Level sensor | Detecting how much fuel is left in a car's tank |
Temperature sensor | Detecting the temperature of a room |
Humidity sensor | Detecting the humidity of a room |
Pressure sensor | Detecting the pressure of a tire |
Electric current sensor | Detecting the current flowing through a wire |
Proximity sensor | Detecting the presence of an object |
Heat sensor | Detecting the heat emitted by an object |
Fluid Velocity sensor | Detecting the speed of a fluid |
Flow sensor | Detecting the flow of a fluid |
Infrared sensor | Detecting the presence of an object using infrared light |
LiDAR sensor | Detecting the distance to an object using laser light |


## Smart sensors : more than just sensing

Some features in a smart sensor:

- self identification
- smart calibration & compensation
- digital sensor data
- multi sensing ability
- sensor communication for remote monitoring and control
- remote configuration

# The brain behind the sensors

Sensors only gather datas. IoT devices act as the brain that collect, process and transmit sensor data to other devices or the cloud.
Different IoT devices have different capabilities and are based on ressources, connectivity and complexity.


# Arduino: Low ressources & Simplicity

Minimal memory, no direct internet connectivity (require more hardware), and use C/C++

# Raspberry Pi: Small computer capabilities

Runs a full OS (Linux), Ethernet/WiFi (IP address), can host web servers, databases, process complex data

# ESP32: Wireless connectivity & efficiency

WiFi & Bluetooth integrated, Energy-efficient (battery powered IoT), and Lightweight OS and easy programming (similar to Arduino)

# IoT Architecture: Hardware, Software and Communication

Perception Layer, Transport Layer, Processing Layer, Application Layer


# Summary and takeaways

IoT connects physical objects to the internet for automation and smarter decisions
Sensors detect physical datas, smart sensors add onboard computing
Many types of sensors
Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32 differ in computing power and connectivity - choose based on your project needs
IoT's complexity comes from integrating diverse technologies smoothly

# Current number of active satellites in orbit 2024

As of July 2024, there are approximately 12,994 operational satellites orbiting the Earth[^1_1]. This number has increased significantly in recent years, with SpaceX's Starlink constellation being the largest contributor, accounting for 6,111 active satellites[^1_1][^1_2]. The rapid growth in satellite deployments has led to a nearly fourfold increase in the number of active satellites over the past five years[^1_2].

The distribution of active satellites by operator or category as of July 2024 is as follows:

1. Starlink: 6,111
2. Geostationary: 1,017
3. Amateur radio: 805
4. OneWeb: 628
5. Other categories (including military, earth science, TV, etc.): 4,433

It's worth noting that the majority of these satellites (93%) are in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)[^1_5]. The United States leads in the number of satellites, with 8,530 in orbit as of November 2024[^1_6]. This rapid increase in satellite deployments is expected to continue, with projections suggesting over 43,000 active satellites in orbit by 2032[^1_5].

# Total number of space debris objects tracked by ESA/NAS

As of March 2025, the European Space Agency (ESA) tracks approximately 39,230 space objects in Earth orbit[^2_5]. This number includes both operational satellites and space debris. The breakdown of these objects is as follows:

1. About 11,100 functioning satellites[^2_5]
2. Approximately 2,560 non-functioning satellites (13,660 total satellites in space minus 11,100 functioning)[^2_5]
3. The remaining objects, roughly 25,570, are considered space debris

It's important to note that this number only represents objects large enough to be tracked by space surveillance networks. ESA's statistical models estimate a much larger number of smaller debris objects that cannot be consistently tracked:

- About 40,500 debris objects larger than 10 cm[^2_5]
- Approximately 1,100,000 debris objects between 1 cm and 10 cm[^2_5]
- An estimated 130 million debris objects between 1 mm and 1 cm[^2_5]

The total mass of all space objects in Earth orbit is estimated to be more than 13,500 tonnes[^2_5]. This increasing amount of space debris poses significant challenges for current and future space operations, prompting initiatives like ESA's Zero Debris Charter to address the issue[^2_3].

The growth rate of space debris since 2000 has been significant and accelerating. Here are key points illustrating this trend:

## Increase in Tracked Objects

- As of March 2025, approximately 39,230 space objects are regularly tracked by Space Surveillance Networks[^3_5].
- This represents more than a 50% increase in tracked space debris objects over the last two decades[^3_4].


## Debris by Size

- Current estimates based on statistical models (as of 2024) show[^3_5]:
    - About 40,500 debris objects larger than 10 cm
    - Approximately 1,100,000 debris objects between 1 cm and 10 cm
    - An estimated 130 million debris objects between 1 mm and 1 cm


## Total Mass and Launch Activity

- The total mass of all space objects in Earth orbit has grown to more than 13,500 tonnes[^3_5].
- Launch traffic has increased dramatically, with current levels around ten times higher than those observed in the early 2000s[^3_6].


## Future Projections

- The space debris removal market is expected to grow from \$0.1 billion in 2024 to \$0.55 billion in 2029, indicating the increasing urgency of addressing this issue[^3_1].
- Some researchers predict that the threat from space debris could quadruple in the next 50 years[^3_3].


## Contributing Factors

- The deployment of large satellite constellations and a shift towards commercial operators have significantly impacted the growth of space debris, particularly in Low Earth Orbit since 2015[^3_6].
- Catastrophic events, such as China's anti-satellite test in 2007 and the collision between Russian and U.S. satellites in 2009, have created thousands of new debris pieces in single incidents[^3_2].

This rapid growth in space debris poses increasing risks to operational satellites and future space missions, highlighting the need for effective debris removal and mitigation strategies.

# Growth rate of space debris since 2000

The growth rate of space debris since 2000 has been significant, driven by increased satellite launches, collisions, and fragmentation events. Here are the key trends and data points:

### Growth in Tracked Objects

- In 2000, there were approximately **9,000 tracked objects** in orbit. By **2025**, this number has grown to over **39,000 tracked objects**, representing a more than **fourfold increase** over 25 years[^4_2][^4_4][^4_5].
- The number of small debris (1–10 cm) is estimated at around **1 million**, while debris larger than 10 cm is approximately **40,500 objects** as of early 2025[^4_6].


### Key Events Contributing to Growth

1. **Anti-Satellite Tests**:
    - The Chinese FY-1C anti-satellite test in 2007 alone added over **3,500 trackable pieces of debris**[^4_4][^4_8].
2. **Collisions**:
    - The 2009 collision between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 satellites created over **2,300 trackable pieces of debris**[^4_4][^4_8].
3. **Satellite Mega-Constellations**:
    - The rapid deployment of constellations like SpaceX's Starlink has significantly increased the number of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), indirectly contributing to collision risks and debris creation[^4_3][^4_6].

### Annual Growth Rate

- Launch activity has increased nearly tenfold since the early 2000s, with over **200 re-entries of spacecraft and upper stages annually** by 2025[^4_6].
- The space debris environment is growing at an **exponential rate**, with the total mass of debris exceeding **13,500 tonnes** in orbit as of 2025[^4_5].


### Long-Term Projections

- Without mitigation efforts, models predict that collisions will become the dominant source of new debris, potentially leading to a "Kessler Syndrome," where debris growth becomes self-sustaining due to cascading collisions[^4_4][^4_7].

The rapid growth underscores the urgent need for international cooperation on mitigation and active removal strategies to ensure the sustainability of space activities.

# Most crowded orbits: GEO, LEO, MEO statistics

The crowding of Earth's orbits varies significantly between Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit (GEO), with LEO being the most congested due to satellite mega-constellations. Here's a breakdown of the current landscape:

---

## **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)**

**Altitude**: 300–2,000 km
**Key Statistics**:

- **Satellite count**: Over 10,000 active satellites as of 2025[^5_4], with projections of **70,000 new LEO satellites** to be launched by 2030[^5_2].
- **Market growth**: Expected to grow from \$6.2 billion (2024) to \$12.31 billion by 2029 (14.5% CAGR)[^5_3].
- **Dominant players**: SpaceX (Starlink ~6,000 satellites), OneWeb (628 satellites), and government/military constellations[^5_5].

**Challenges**:

- **Crowding**: The 700–900 km altitude band is a "danger zone" akin to crowded air corridors[^5_5].
- **Debris risk**: MIT studies warn that emissions could reduce LEO's carrying capacity by **50–66% by 2100** due to increased collision risks[^5_4].

---

## **Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit (GEO)**

**Altitude**: ~35,786 km
**Key Statistics**:

- **Satellite count**: ~1,017 active satellites[^5_1][^5_7].
- **Market size**: \$17.24 billion (2024), growing to \$21.93 billion by 2029 (4.8% CAGR)[^5_7].
- **Dominant players**: Airbus, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin focus on heavy satellites (>500 kg) for communications and broadcasting[^5_1].

**Trends**:

- **Technological shifts**: Adoption of electric propulsion and AI-driven payloads to extend satellite lifespans[^5_1].
- **Regulatory pressure**: Limited orbital slots and spectrum allocation create barriers for new entrants[^5_1].

---

## **Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)**

**Altitude**: 2,000–35,786 km
**Key Statistics**:

- **Satellite count**: Smaller numbers compared to LEO/GEO, primarily hosting navigation systems (e.g., GPS, Galileo).
- **Market growth**: Projected to grow from \$53.71 billion (2025) to \$86.79 billion by 2030 (10.07% CAGR)[^5_6].
- **Recent developments**: SES's O3b mPOWER constellation and the EU's IRISS initiative aim to expand secure communications[^5_6].

---

### **Comparison of Orbital Crowding**

| **Orbit** | **Satellite Count** | **Market Size (2025)** | **Primary Use Cases** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| LEO | ~10,000+[^5_4] | \$7.16B[^5_3] | Broadband, Earth observation |
| GEO | ~1,017[^5_1] | \$18.15B[^5_7] | Communications, broadcasting |
| MEO | Hundreds | \$53.71B[^5_6] | Navigation, secure communications |

---

**Critical Concerns**:

- **LEO sustainability**: Current debris models estimate **40,500 trackable objects >10 cm** in LEO[^5_4], with cascading collisions posing a "runaway instability" risk by 2100[^5_4].
- **GEO limitations**: High costs and slot scarcity hinder growth despite stable demand[^5_1].
- **MEO potential**: Rising investments in secure communications and navigation drive its market, though physical crowding remains lower[^5_6].

While LEO dominates in sheer satellite numbers, GEO remains critical for high-bandwidth applications, and MEO is gaining traction for specialized services. Managing orbital carrying capacity will require international collaboration to mitigate debris risks[^5_5].

# E.E. Peterkin 1961 satellite collision prediction

The 1961 satellite collision event referenced in the search results pertains to the breakup of **Satellite 1961-Omicron** (also known as Transit 4A), which occurred on June 29, 1961. This event marked the first major accidental fragmentation in space history, creating over **300 trackable debris pieces** and significantly increasing the workload for space surveillance systems at the time[^6_2][^6_9]. However, none of the provided sources explicitly mention **E.E. Peterkin** or any specific individual associated with predicting this collision.

### Key Details from Search Results:

1. **1961-Omicron Breakup**:
    - The satellite’s disintegration tripled the number of trackable debris objects overnight, overwhelming computational resources like the Naval Ordnance Research Calculator (NORC) and requiring emergency use of the faster IBM 7090 system[^6_2].
    - This event exposed critical limitations in early space debris tracking and prediction methods, prompting advancements in orbit determination models.
2. **Computational Challenges**:
    - At the time, orbit predictions relied on analytical methods like **SGP4**, which had limited accuracy (kilometer-level errors) and required frequent updates[^6_2][^6_8].
    - The 1961 incident highlighted the need for improved numerical integration techniques and better computational infrastructure.

### Context for Prediction Accuracy:

- Early collision prediction methods in the 1960s were rudimentary due to sparse tracking networks and underdeveloped mathematical models.
- Modern systems, such as laser-based tracking (accurate to ~100 meters) and AI-driven force models, now address these historical limitations[^6_8].

While the 1961 event is well-documented as a catalyst for improving debris mitigation practices, the name **E.E. Peterkin** does not appear in the provided sources. This suggests either a gap in the search materials or a possible misspelling/misattribution. For authoritative confirmation, archival records from organizations like NASA or NORAD would need to be consulted.

# Donald J. Kessler Kessler Syndrome original paper

Donald J. Kessler first proposed the Kessler Syndrome in his seminal 1978 paper titled "Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt," published in the Journal of Geophysical Research (JGR)[^7_1][^7_5][^7_6]. This paper, co-authored with Burton G. Cour-Palais, demonstrated that the process controlling asteroid evolution would cause a similar collision process in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) within decades rather than billions of years[^7_1].

Key points from Kessler's original paper:

1. It predicted that fragments from random collisions between catalogued objects in LEO would become an important source of small debris beginning around the year 2000[^7_3].
2. The paper concluded that by about 2000, space debris would outpace micrometeoroids as the primary ablative risk to orbiting spacecraft[^7_1].
3. Kessler proposed that the debris flux would increase exponentially with time, even if no new objects were added to orbit[^7_3].

The term "Kessler Syndrome" itself was not used in the original paper. It was later coined by John Gabbard, another NASA scientist, shortly after the publication of the 1978 paper[^7_1][^7_3]. The term gained widespread use after appearing in a 1982 Popular Science article[^7_1].

Kessler's work laid the foundation for understanding the potential long-term consequences of space debris accumulation and has since become a cornerstone in the field of orbital debris research and space sustainability[^7_7].

# NASA historical reports on space debris 1970s

NASA's research on space debris in the 1970s marked a significant turning point in understanding the risks associated with orbital pollution. Key developments during this period include:

## Establishment of the NASA Orbital Debris Program

- Founded in 1979 at Johnson Space Center[^8_7]
- Aimed to research mitigation measures for space debris in Earth orbit[^8_5]


## Groundbreaking Research

- Donald J. Kessler and Burton G. Cour-Palais published "Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt" in 1978[^8_6]
- This paper predicted that fragments from random collisions between cataloged objects in LEO would become a significant source of small debris by 2000[^8_6]
- Concluded that space debris would outpace micrometeoroids as the primary ablative risk to orbiting spacecraft[^8_6]


## Improved Detection Capabilities

- NASA and MIT Lincoln Laboratory developed technology to detect debris as small as 5 millimeters[^8_1]
- This led to the discovery of an unusual concentration of debris at 900-1,000 kilometers altitude, later identified as sodium potassium droplets from Soviet nuclear reactors[^8_1]


## Shift in Perception

- Prior to the late 1970s, it was widely believed that atmospheric drag would de-orbit debris faster than it was created[^8_6]
- Kessler's work challenged this assumption, demonstrating that the collision process in LEO would occur in decades rather than billions of years[^8_6]


## Data Collection and Analysis

- When the NORAD database became publicly available in the 1970s, NASA scientists applied asteroid-belt study techniques to analyze known orbital objects[^8_6]
- Optical telescopes and short-wavelength radar were used to measure the number and size of space objects, revealing that the published population count was at least 50% too low[^8_6]


## International Collaboration

- NASA began conferring with the European Space Agency about debris in 1987, which eventually led to broader international discussions[^8_3]

These efforts in the 1970s laid the foundation for modern space debris research and mitigation strategies, highlighting the growing risks of orbital pollution and the need for active management of the space environment.

# Average lifespan of Thales Alenia Space satellites

Based on the available information, the average lifespan of Thales Alenia Space satellites varies depending on the specific satellite series and mission:

1. Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites:
    - MSG-1 (Meteosat-8) has exceeded 19 years in orbit, setting a record for longevity[^9_1].
2. Iridium NEXT satellites:
    - Initially designed for a 12.5-year lifespan.
    - Recently extended to 17.5 years, with potential for further extension[^9_3].
3. Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) satellites:
    - Designed for a lifespan of 8.5 years[^9_9].
4. General satellite reliability:
    - Satellites often follow a "bathtub" reliability curve, with higher failure rates in the first year and towards the end of their designed lifespan[^9_6].
    - Mid-life is typically the phase showing the highest reliability, although some satellite types may experience issues around years 6 and 12[^9_6].

While specific average lifespans for all Thales Alenia Space satellites are not provided, the data suggests that many of their satellites exceed their initial design lifespans, with some series lasting well over a decade. The company's satellites demonstrate a track record of longevity, with ongoing efforts to extend operational lifespans when possible.

# Cost vs. durability in satellite manufacturing

The cost vs. durability tradeoff in satellite manufacturing is a crucial consideration for satellite designers and manufacturers. This tradeoff involves balancing the upfront costs of building more durable satellites against the long-term benefits of extended operational lifespans.

## Cost Considerations

1. **Initial Manufacturing Costs**:
    - Designing satellites for longer lifespans typically increases upfront costs due to:
        - Additional propellant for orbit maintenance
        - Increased power generation and storage capabilities
        - More robust components to withstand long-term space exposure[^12_1]
2. **Cost Per Operational Day**:
    - As design lifetime increases, the cost per operational day tends to decrease
    - This metric is calculated by dividing the cost to Initial Operational Capability (IOC) by the design lifetime in days[^12_1]
3. **Launch Costs**:
    - More durable satellites are often larger and heavier, potentially increasing launch costs
    - However, launch costs have been decreasing due to reusable launch vehicles and ridesharing options[^12_2]

## Durability Factors

1. **Design Lifetime**:
    - Satellite design lifetimes have increased from an average of 7 years to 15 years over the past two decades[^12_1]
    - Longer lifespans allow for greater return on investment
2. **Technological Obsolescence**:
    - Extending satellite lifespans increases the risk of technical and commercial obsolescence before end-of-life[^12_1]
3. **Reliability**:
    - Satellites often follow a "bathtub" reliability curve, with higher failure rates in the first year and towards the end of their designed lifespan

## Optimization Strategies

1. **Tradeoff Analysis**:
    - Manufacturers use effectiveness-cost tradeoff optimization techniques to balance performance and cost[^12_3]
2. **Design/Cost Tradeoff Studies**:
    - NASA and other agencies conduct studies to optimize satellite system designs for cost-effectiveness[^12_4]
3. **Hardware Configuration Tradeoffs**:
    - Earth observation satellite designers must balance different hardware components to optimize performance within cost constraints[^12_5]
4. **Cost Estimating Methodologies**:
    - Specialized methodologies are being developed to address the unique nature of satellite constellation manufacturing and integration[^12_6]

## Industry Trends

1. **Increasing Affordability**:
    - Overall satellite affordability has improved due to:
        - Increased capacity and throughput
        - Miniaturization and production at scale
        - Software-defined payloads offering more flexibility[^12_2]
2. **Performance Improvements**:
    - Throughput per kg of satellite weight increased six times between 2013 and 2021
    - Manufacturing cost per Gbps of capacity dropped by 90% in the same period[^12_2]
3. **Shift to Larger Constellations**:
    - The industry is moving towards larger constellations of smaller, less expensive satellites
    - This approach can provide redundancy and more frequent technology refreshes[^12_2]

In conclusion, while designing for durability often increases upfront costs, it can lead to lower costs per operational day over the satellite's lifetime. However, manufacturers must carefully balance this against the risk of obsolescence and the potential benefits of newer, more affordable satellite technologies. The ongoing trend towards more affordable and flexible satellite designs is reshaping the industry's approach to the cost vs. durability tradeoff.

# Aluminium oxide from burning satellites ozone layer impact

The impact of aluminum oxide from burning satellites on the ozone layer is emerging as a significant environmental concern:

## Aluminum Oxide Formation

- Satellites, often made of aluminum, release aluminum oxide particles when they burn up during atmospheric reentry[^13_1][^13_5].
- By the 2030s, up to 3,200 metric tons of satellite bodies could burn up annually, releasing 630 metric tons of aluminum oxides into the upper atmosphere[^13_1].


## Ozone Depletion Mechanism

- Aluminum oxides catalyze destructive reactions between ozone and chlorine, depleting the ozone layer[^13_3][^13_7].
- These particles are not consumed in the process, allowing them to continue destroying ozone molecules for decades[^13_7].


## Concentration and Persistence

- Aluminum oxide concentrations in the atmosphere could increase by 650% in the coming decades[^13_1].
- It takes up to 30 years for these particles to reach the altitudes where the ozone layer resides[^13_1][^13_7].


## Potential Impact

- The effects on the ozone layer could be "potentially significant," threatening its ongoing recovery[^13_1][^13_3].
- Researchers estimate over 360 metric tons of aluminum oxide compounds may enter the atmosphere annually from large satellite constellations[^13_5].


## Current Trends

- Aluminum oxide particles from satellite reentry have increased 8-fold between 2016 and 2022[^13_9].
- With up to 50,000 new satellites projected to launch by 2030, the issue is likely to intensify[^13_6].


## Research and Regulation

- The first comprehensive study on the environmental impact of deorbited satellites is currently underway[^13_6].
- Regulatory bodies like the FCC are beginning to consider these impacts in satellite approval processes[^13_8].

This emerging issue highlights the need for further research and potential regulatory action to mitigate the environmental impact of the growing satellite industry on Earth's protective ozone layer.

# Starlink re-entry pollution study

A recent study published in June 2024 in Geophysical Research Letters highlights the potential environmental impact of Starlink satellite re-entries:

1. Aluminum oxide pollution:
    - Each 250 kg Starlink satellite produces about 30 kg of aluminum oxide nanoparticles upon re-entry[^14_2][^14_4].
    - These particles can persist in the atmosphere for decades, potentially affecting atmospheric chemistry[^14_4].
2. Increasing pollution levels:
    - Aluminum oxide concentrations in the atmosphere increased 8-fold between 2016 and 2022[^14_1][^14_7].
    - In 2022, satellite re-entries released 41.7 metric tons of aluminum, 29.5% above natural levels[^14_4].
3. Ozone depletion concerns:
    - Aluminum oxide particles can catalyze reactions that activate chlorine, contributing to ozone depletion[^14_4].
    - These particles can take up to 30 years to descend from the mesosphere to the stratospheric ozone layer[^14_4].
4. Future projections:
    - If current trends continue, excess aluminum in the upper mesosphere could exceed natural levels by over 640% annually[^14_4].
    - This could result in more than 360 metric tons of aluminum oxide clusters per year[^14_4].
5. Regulatory implications:
    - The FCC has begun considering these environmental impacts in satellite approval processes[^14_5].
    - There are currently no international regulations addressing the long-term atmospheric impact of satellite re-entries[^14_4].

The study emphasizes the need for further research and potential regulatory action to mitigate the environmental impact of the growing satellite industry on Earth's protective ozone layer[^14_1][^14_4].

# Toxic materials in satellites atmospheric re-entry

The atmospheric re-entry of satellites releases several potentially toxic materials:

1. Aluminum oxide:
    - A typical 250-kg satellite generates around 30 kg of aluminum oxide nanoparticles upon re-entry[^15_6].
    - These particles can persist in the atmosphere for decades and may contribute to ozone depletion[^15_1][^15_6].
2. Other metals:
    - Over 20 elements from satellite re-entry have been detected in stratospheric sulfuric acid particles, including lithium, copper, and lead[^15_3].
    - The mass of these metals now exceeds the natural cosmic dust influx[^15_3].
3. Nitrogen oxides (NOx):
    - Produced by the extreme speeds of re-entering satellites, compressing atmospheric nitrogen and causing it to react with oxygen[^15_7].
4. Black carbon particles:
    - Released during the burning process of satellite components[^15_5].
5. Carbon monoxide:
    - Another byproduct of satellite combustion during re-entry[^15_5].

Environmental impacts:

- Ozone depletion: Aluminum oxide particles can catalyze reactions that activate chlorine, contributing to ozone destruction[^15_1][^15_4].
- Atmospheric pollution: By 2022, aluminum re-entry from satellites exceeded natural levels from micrometeoroids by 29.5%[^15_1].
- Potential climate effects: Some re-entry materials may cool the stratosphere, while others could warm it[^15_7].

The increasing number of satellites, particularly large constellations in Low Earth Orbit, is exacerbating these concerns. Projections suggest that by 2030, over 360 metric tons of aluminum oxide compounds could be released annually from satellite re-entries[^15_1][^15_6].

# Graveyard orbit capacity and limitations

Graveyard orbits, primarily used for retiring geostationary satellites, have several capacity limitations and challenges:

## Altitude Requirements

- The minimum perigee altitude for graveyard orbits is typically 300 km above the geostationary orbit.
- This includes a 200 km buffer for the GEO-protected zone and an additional 35 km for gravitational perturbations.
- Some agencies recommend even higher altitudes, with the UK suggesting more than 400 km above GEO.


## Capacity Concerns

- As of 2024, there were over 300 operational satellites in GEO, with a total population of 1,036 objects.
- The number of satellites in graveyard orbits is increasing each year, raising concerns about long-term sustainability.
- The growing debris density in graveyard orbits may eventually reach an unacceptable level of collision risk.


## Limitations

1. **Collision Risk**: Debris created by collisions in graveyard orbits can potentially reach the geostationary arc.
2. **Long-term Stability**: Objects in near-geostationary orbits exhibit a 53-year cycle of orbital inclination variation of ±7.4°.
3. **Fuel Requirements**: Moving a satellite to a graveyard orbit requires about the same amount of fuel as three months of stationkeeping.
4. **Compliance Issues**: As of 2005, only about one-third of satellite operators successfully moved their satellites to graveyard orbits.

## Future Considerations

- Some experts argue that graveyard orbits are not a sustainable long-term solution for satellite disposal.
- Alternative concepts, such as the "Necropolis" system, propose actively managing and securing multiple objects in a controlled environment to reduce collision risks.


## Regulatory Measures

- The FCC requires all geostationary satellites launched after March 18, 2002, to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at end-of-life.
- International standards, such as those set by the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordinating Committee (IADC), provide guidelines for graveyard orbit altitudes and procedures.

As the number of satellites continues to grow, the capacity and long-term viability of graveyard orbits remain significant concerns for the space industry and regulatory bodies.

# Space net debris capture technology

Space net debris capture technology is an innovative approach to addressing the growing issue of space debris. Key features of this technology include:

## Net Capture System

- Developed by Airbus DS in Bremen, Germany
- Designed to capture objects up to 2 meters in diameter
- Uses a hemispherical 5m net for debris capture
- Employs deployment weights to pull out and inflate the net
- Includes a tether line to connect the net to the service spacecraft
- Features an active closure mechanism to secure captured objects


## Deployment Process

1. The net is stored in a container on the satellite
2. Deployment weights are ejected to pull out and inflate the net
3. The net approaches and envelops the target debris
4. Motors in the weights activate to close the net around the debris
5. A tether line connects the captured object to the satellite for deorbiting

## Key Advantages

- Flexibility to capture various object shapes, sizes, and tumbling rates
- Suitable for non-cooperative targets
- Redundant systems for increased reliability
- Potential for upscaling to capture objects up to 12 meters in size


## Testing and Demonstration

- The RemoveDEBRIS mission, launched in 2018, successfully demonstrated this technology in orbit
- Qualification and acceptance tests were completed in June 2016
- The system underwent parabolic flight testing for validation

Space net debris capture technology represents a promising solution for active debris removal, addressing the critical need to clean up Earth's orbits and ensure sustainable space activities[^21_1][^21_3][^21_5].

# Kinetic kill vehicles for space debris

Kinetic kill vehicles (KKVs) have been used in anti-satellite (ASAT) tests, creating significant space debris:

1. China's 2007 ASAT Test:
    - Destroyed the Fengyun-1C weather satellite at 865 km altitude
    - Used an SC-19 kinetic kill vehicle
    - Created a massive debris field in low-Earth orbit[^22_3][^22_4]
2. Russia's 2021 ASAT Test:
    - Missile's kinetic kill vehicle impacted a satellite
    - Generated a large debris field, triggering emergency responses[^22_5][^22_7]
3. Debris Creation:
    - KKVs collide with satellites at high relative velocities (e.g., ~9 km/s)
    - Impacts fragment satellites into numerous debris pieces[^22_2]

While effective for destroying satellites, KKVs are problematic for space sustainability:

- Generate significant amounts of orbital debris
- Increase collision risks for other spacecraft
- Contribute to the growing space debris problem

Alternative, less destructive methods for satellite neutralization are being explored:

- Non-kinetic approaches like dazzling lasers, cyber-attacks, and electronic jamming
- These methods aim to minimize debris creation in potential space conflicts[^22_8]

For debris mitigation, focus has shifted to non-destructive removal technologies and prevention strategies rather than using kinetic kill vehicles.

# Laser debris removal experiments

Recent laser debris removal experiments have made significant progress in demonstrating the feasibility of this technology:

## Thrust Measurement Experiment (JAXA)

- Conducted on the International Space Station in 2023
- Uses the Electrostatic Levitation Furnace to simulate isolated space debris
- Examines thrust and temperature of debris targeted by a small-power continuous wave laser
- Aims to determine if space debris removal with a small-power laser is feasible


## Ground-Based Experiments

- Studies have tested short-wavelength laser pulses focused on debris >10 cm
- Laser ablation generates plasma plumes ejecting at ~105 m/s, decreasing orbital velocity
- Simulations show potential to guide debris into Earth's atmosphere for disintegration


## Space-Based Laser System Test

- Simulated 20 kW laser in 800 km Sun Synchronous Orbit
- 600 J energy pulses at 33.33 Hz repetition frequency
- Tested on 5000 simulated debris objects
- After 10 days, reduced lifetime of 334 objects to <25 years and 614 objects to ≤1 month

These experiments demonstrate promising results for laser-based debris removal, showing potential for both ground and space-based systems to effectively reduce the population of small orbital debris.

# UNOOSA space debris mitigation guidelines

The Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, endorsed by the UN General Assembly in 2007, provide a framework for reducing the creation of space debris. Key aspects of these guidelines include:

1. Limiting debris released during normal operations[^24_3][^24_5]
2. Minimizing the potential for break-ups during operational phases[^24_3][^24_5]
3. Limiting the probability of accidental collisions in orbit[^24_7]
4. Avoiding intentional destruction and other harmful activities[^24_6]
5. Minimizing potential for post-mission break-ups resulting from stored energy[^24_6]
6. Limiting the long-term presence of spacecraft and launch vehicle orbital stages in low Earth orbit (LEO) after mission completion[^24_5]

These guidelines are not legally binding but are intended to be implemented voluntarily by member states and international organizations through national mechanisms or applicable procedures[^24_3][^24_5]. They apply to mission planning, design, manufacture, and operational phases of spacecraft and launch vehicles[^24_3][^24_5].

The guidelines build upon the technical content and definitions from the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) guidelines while considering UN treaties and principles on outer space[^24_7]. They aim to promote responsible and sustainable use of space through debris mitigation practices and procedures[^24_3][^24_5].

# FCC/ESA regulations on satellite deorbiting

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and European Space Agency (ESA) have recently implemented stricter regulations on satellite deorbiting to address the growing issue of space debris:

## FCC Regulations

- In September 2022, the FCC adopted a new "5-year rule" for deorbiting satellites[^25_1][^25_5].
- This rule requires satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) below 2000 km to be deorbited within 5 years after their mission ends[^25_5][^25_7].
- Previously, there was only a 25-year guideline for post-mission satellite deorbiting[^25_5].
- Satellite operators must submit a deorbit plan prior to launch[^25_3].


## ESA Regulations

- ESA updated its Space Debris Mitigation Policy and Requirements in November 2023[^25_4].
- The disposal phase in LEO has been reduced from 25 years to a maximum of 5 years[^25_4].
- The probability of successful disposal must be larger than 90%, with stricter requirements for large constellations[^25_4].
- Space objects in protected orbital regions must be equipped with interfaces to facilitate servicing by active debris removal missions if they fail in orbit[^25_4].

These new regulations aim to minimize space debris and reduce collision risks in increasingly crowded orbits. Both agencies are working towards achieving debris neutrality and ensuring sustainable use of space.

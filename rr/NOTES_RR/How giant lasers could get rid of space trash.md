## The Growing Problem of Space Debris
- Humans have filled the space around [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) with trash, including discarded rocket bodies, mission-related debris, and thousands of satellites, many of which are no longer functional, crisscrossing at high speeds just above Earth's atmosphere, increasing the probability of catastrophic in-orbit collisions [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=0s).
- The crowding of Earth's orbit is steadily increasing due to the booming space industry launching more objects into orbit than ever before, which could lead to a runaway chain reaction of collisions and fragmentation, filling Earth's orbit with so much debris that space will become unusable to humans [(00:00:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=26s).
- To fix the space debris problem, scientists and companies are working on various solutions, including trash collecting spacecraft armed with harpoons and nets, a giant cloud of metal dust, and lasers, which could halt dangerous bits of garbage in their tracks [(00:00:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=51s).
- The vast majority of human-made objects surrounding Earth are in a region called "low Earth orbit," where communication satellites, spacecraft like the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station), and a massive amount of space trash are located [(00:01:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=79s).
- The more objects put in space, the more chances they have of smashing into each other, breaking apart, and multiplying, which could lead to a theoretical cascade effect called the "[Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome)," introduced in the 1970s, warning of an uncontrollable number of catastrophic collisions [(00:01:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=93s).

## Removing Large Space Debris
- To get rid of most space debris, it needs to be slowed down enough to fall out of orbit and into Earth's atmosphere, where it burns up and is destroyed, but different sized space junk requires different approaches to do this [(00:02:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=145s).
- The biggest bits of space debris, measuring more than 10 centimeters in size, can be tracked from [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) and slowed down using tiny spacecraft that can reach these objects and guide them down to Earth's atmosphere to be destroyed [(00:02:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=157s).
- Commercial companies like Europe's [ClearSpace-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearSpace-1) and Japan's [Astroscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroscale) are working with global space agencies to demonstrate the removal of large debris sometime in the next decade [(00:02:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=179s).

## Tackling Small Debris: Sweepers and Dust Clouds
- The two smaller classifications of space debris, which come from fragmentation events like explosions and collisions, are difficult to track and require different removal methods, such as a physical sweeper placed in orbit that could catch or slow them down enough to de-orbit them [(00:03:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=191s).
- Releasing a cloud of tungsten dust on top of debris is a cost-effective solution that could weigh down the objects and drag them into Earth's atmosphere to be destroyed, but it could also contribute to space pollution [(00:03:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=229s).

## Lasers as a Solution for Medium-Sized Debris
- The sweeper and tungsten dust ideas are not practical solutions, but there is another option for dealing with space debris in the middle, which is 1 to 10 centimeters in size and presents a unique problem because it is too small to track but big enough to cause serious damage [(00:04:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=254s).
- Focusing on this range of debris would be highly effective in managing the space debris problem, according to analysis from [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA), and lasers can be used to nudge fast-moving pieces of small debris and disrupt its orbit [(00:04:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=274s).
- Lasers can direct a beam of energy and apply force to an object without making physical contact, and they could be used to knock debris into higher orbits or lower it into Earth's atmosphere to be destroyed, which is sometimes referred to as a "laser broom" [(00:04:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=281s).
- A ground-based laser system was proposed by NASA's [Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)) in 1996, and according to NASA's 2023 cost and benefit analysis, a ground- or space-based laser system would be the most cost-effective way to remove debris of 1 to 10 centimeter size [(00:05:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=303s).

## How Laser Brooms Work
- Claude Phipps, who originally proposed the idea of using lasers to deal with space debris, explains that a ground-based laser for debris removal would work by detecting a small piece of debris with a radar system and locking onto its position, then firing a near-instantaneous pulse of energy through the atmosphere [(00:05:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=346s).
- A space-based laser would work similarly, but with a more favorable angle to shoot debris downward into Earth's atmosphere, and without the need to correct for Earth's atmosphere or long distances, making it potentially more efficient [(00:06:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=375s).
- However, a space-based laser would not have access to Earth's power grid and would be more difficult to maintain, whereas a ground-based laser would be cheaper but have a less favorable geometry [(00:06:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=396s).
- A laser system could also be highly effective for dealing with large debris by nudging it out of the way of a spacecraft's orbit when an incoming collision is detected, which would be more cost-effective and potentially safer than other methods [(00:06:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=416s).

## Developing and Implementing Laser Technology
- The technology to develop ground- and space-based lasers to fight space debris is available, but the main obstacle is a lack of financial commitment, as it is not a question of knowing what to do, but rather people committing to it [(00:07:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=450s).
- There are commercial companies around the world working on this technology, and a future with ground- and space-based laser systems cleaning up space debris may not be far away, with companies like EX-Fusion and [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) potentially developing laser broom technology [(00:07:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=458s).

## Legal and International Cooperation Challenges
- International space law currently forbids any body from touching an object in space that it didn't launch, which means that even if a laser broom is developed, it cannot be used on a dead satellite from another country, and this issue needs to be resolved by lawyers [(00:07:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=471s).
- Cleaning up space debris will require an international effort and cooperation from commercial actors like [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX), and it is not just about removing existing debris, but also about preventing the creation of new debris [(00:08:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=494s).

## Preventing Future Debris and Mitigation Efforts
- The European Space Agency's Zero Debris Charter and the US FCC's new rule requiring US-based spacecraft to de-orbit themselves within five years of mission's end are examples of efforts to mitigate space debris by preventing the creation of new debris [(00:08:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=503s).
- A combination of remediation and mitigation efforts is projected to make serious progress in battling the space debris problem, and it is essential for everyone using space as a resource to change their habit of littering before it's too late [(00:08:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=531s).

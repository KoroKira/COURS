- After 60 years of [Space Activities Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Activities_Bill), approximately 8,000 tons of human-made objects crowd near Earth's space, with 6,300 tons being dead satellites and [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) posing a great risk to the use of space [(00:00:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEjYyu1H5M&t=6s).
- The volume of debris would continue to grow even if no new launches were made, due to future breakups and collisions, making it essential to remove large items of debris from space to prevent a chain reaction [(00:00:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEjYyu1H5M&t=24s).
- The Clean Space's e.Deorbit mission aims to catch and dispose of a derelict ESA-owned satellite, a world-first mission that presents many challenges, such as grabbing onto a spinning object without crashing [(00:00:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEjYyu1H5M&t=42s).
- To capture the debris, investigators are considering methods such as using a net or a robotic arm, with the final method selected needing to secure the debris target firmly for safe disposal [(00:01:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEjYyu1H5M&t=79s).
- The chosen capture method must allow for the debris to be dragged down to burn up safely during re-entry, requiring precise movement and synchronization with the spinning object [(00:01:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEjYyu1H5M&t=74s).
- The success of this mission would pave the way for a cleaner space, with the world's first active debris removal mission setting a precedent for future debris removal efforts [(00:01:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEjYyu1H5M&t=95s).

# The Truth About Space Debris
![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/itdYS9XF4a0/maxresdefault.jpg)



## The Growing Problem of Space Debris
- [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) conducted its first successful anti-satellite test on March 27th, 2019, by launching a three-stage missile that intercepted and shattered its military satellite, [Microsat-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsat-R), into hundreds of pieces, contributing to the growing [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) problem [(00:00:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=12s).
- The test was universally condemned as a completely unnecessary political posturing move that added significantly to Earth's space debris problem, with the probability of collisions occurring continually rising, and several collision events having already damaged the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) and other high-value satellites [(00:00:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=50s).
- Every launch into space generates unwanted waste, including solid-fuel rockets depositing aluminium-oxide particles, explosive bolts fragmenting into pieces, and even chips of paint causing issues, such as the 1983 incident where a 0.2 mm chip of paint gouged a pit out of one of the Challenger space shuttle's windows [(00:01:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=80s).
- Post-mission analysis of the Space Shuttle launches found that 177 impacts were caused by space debris, with 44% being caused by aluminium alloys, 37% by paint chips, 12% by steel, 5% by copper, and 2% by titanium, resulting in significant damage and costly repairs [(00:01:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=108s).

## The Increasing Likelihood of Collisions
- The likelihood of a collision between a satellite in low [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) orbit and a piece of debris over 1 centimeter in size has increased over time, from 17-20% in 2007 to 25-33% later that year, and to 50% by 2010, after the collision between [Iridium 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_33) and [Kosmos 2251](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_2251) satellites [(00:02:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=142s).
- The chances of collision are not small, and it is only a matter of time before another serious incident occurs, making it prudent to design satellites to withstand small impacts and dodge larger ones, such as the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station), which can withstand objects up to 1 centimeter in size and dodge larger trackable objects [(00:03:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=201s).
- The biggest danger to the occupants of the International [Space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station) are objects between 1-10 centimeters in size that are untrackable but large enough to cause serious damage, and [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) has laid out a basic risk management policy to minimize this risk, aiming for a probability of less than 19% over 10 years [(00:03:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=230s).

## Protecting the International Space Station
- [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) is a constant risk that astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) need to be aware of, with a constant undercurrent awareness of the risk of something hitting the spaceship and causing a leak [(00:04:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=283s).
- The ISS uses a multilayer shielding system, known as a [Whipple shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipple_shield), which takes advantage of the debris' own velocity to stop it by creating a shield composed of several thin sheets of armor separated by space [(00:06:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=392s).
- The Whipple shield is an elegant and efficient solution, as using heavy plates for shielding, like those used on tanks on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), would be too heavy and expensive, with a 1 meter squared aluminum plate weighing around 338 kilograms and costing around $31.5 million to launch [(00:05:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=359s).
- The Whipple shield works by breaking up the projectile into thousands of smaller superheated fragments, spreading the energy of the impact over a larger area, and has been tested by the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency), which found that it can protect against small debris [(00:06:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=405s).
- Astronauts, such as former [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) commander [Chris Hadfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hadfield), are occasionally reminded of the space debris problem, and have to be careful not to cut their suits while on space walks on sharp impact edges, with some even reporting hearing the sound of small debris hitting the ship [(00:07:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=446s).
- The Whipple shield is only effective for smaller debris, and larger particles would tear right through it, highlighting the need for continued research and development of shielding technologies [(00:08:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=488s).

## Managing the Risk of Space Debris
- The risk of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) is managed through a combination of shielding, procedures, and understanding the statistics of the risk, including the relative risk of man-made debris versus naturally occurring debris [(00:05:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=306s).
- The International [Space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station) (ISS) and other satellites have to dodge incoming space debris, with ground-based radar systems like the Haystack Radar providing spatial data on the debris, which includes information on size, speed, and direction [(00:08:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=500s).
- The data from the radar system is fed into a database that allows [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) and other space agencies to predict potential collisions and plan maneuvers to avoid them, with the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) having an exclusion zone of 50 kilometers squared and 0.75 kilometers deep around it [(00:08:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=505s).
- If the risk of collision is between one in ten thousand and one in one hundred thousand, the ISS receives a yellow warning, and flight controllers must perform avoidance maneuvers if they do not interfere with mission objectives [(00:09:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=560s).
- In cases where the risk of collision is greater than one in ten thousand, a red warning is received, and the ISS must take action, which can include using control momentum gyros to alter its orientation or thrusters to provide acceleration [(00:09:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=581s).

## The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope Incident
- The [Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_Gamma-ray_Space_Telescope) received an automated email alert in 2012 about a predicted incursion with a retired Russian spy satellite, [Kosmos 1805](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1805), and performed a 1-second burn to separate the two satellites [(00:10:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=624s).

## The Future of Space Debris and its Management
- The issue of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) is expected to grow as human activities in space increase, and it is essential to think more seriously about managing the cosmic neighborhood, with mainstream media often being alarmist about the issue [(00:11:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=678s).
- Despite the concerns, space debris does not pose an immediate threat to space travel, and most debris is too small to see, with massive debris like the upper stage of Apollo 12's [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V) rocket being easy to dodge [(00:11:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=709s).
- A significant amount of debris from India's anti-satellite test will have drifted back to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), similar to the US's [Operation Burnt Frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Burnt_Frost) in 2008, which had similar orbits and altitudes, with the majority of debris falling back to earth within 2 months [(00:12:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=737s).
- The larger trackable debris from Operation Burnt Frost took around 2 years to return to earth, while smaller debris decays faster due to a larger area to mass ratio, making them more sensitive to atmospheric drag [(00:12:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=758s).
- Even in orbit, molecules collide with satellites and debris, causing them to lose altitude, and this natural process is not a reason to ignore the problem of space debris [(00:13:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=780s).
- The potential loss of money from damaging collisions and the potential chain reaction in a busy earth orbit will motivate efforts to fix the problem, as entire economies have been built upon the services provided by satellites [(00:13:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=792s).
- International treaties dictating space operations need to be updated to mitigate the issue, requiring satellites to be capable of bringing themselves out of orbit and dodging debris when needed [(00:13:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=811s).
- Active clearance may be needed to keep [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) at a reasonable level, and launching more objects into orbit to solve the problem is not a viable solution, as it will add to the space debris problem [(00:13:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=835s).

## Potential Solutions and International Cooperation
- A more promising technology involves using high power lasers to ablate material from debris, providing thrust to slow its orbit and increase its rate of decay, but this technology raises concerns about its potential use as an anti-satellite weapon [(00:14:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=864s).
- International cooperation is necessary to address the issue of space debris, and it can become a uniting problem for space-faring nations, just like the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) became an international effort to unite mankind [(00:14:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=888s).

## Social Media Links
- Links to [Social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media) platforms, including [Instagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram), [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter), Discord server, and subreddit, are available for those who want to see more content [(00:16:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=965s).
- The links to these platforms can be found below the current section, allowing easy access to additional information and community engagement [(00:16:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=970s).

## The Growing Threat of Orbital Debris
- The Earth's orbit is filled with thousands of satellites that are crucial to daily life, but each launch also generates debris that accumulates and poses a danger to other satellites and future space missions [(00:00:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=11s).
- Since the beginning of space exploration, the amount of waste in orbit has been increasing, and if not addressed, it will eventually become impossible to use space for satellites, threatening to turn space dreams into nightmares [(00:00:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=47s).
- Satellites are launched into space where they follow an elliptical path around the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), undertaking precise missions such as photographing the Earth, relaying signals, and spying, but they can break down or stop working when they run out of power, becoming [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) [(00:02:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=121s).
- There are nearly a million objects larger than half an inch in orbit, and being struck by orbital debris is a constant threat to all satellites, risking a significant setback to society if not addressed [(00:03:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=204s).
- The problem of orbital debris began 60 years ago with the launch of [Sputnik 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1), the world's first satellite, which stopped working after 21 days and disintegrated in the Earth's atmosphere, but its brief existence had global consequences [(00:04:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=257s).
- The space race between the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) led to a significant increase in satellite launches, including spy satellites fueled by nuclear reactors, some of which were defective and posed a risk to the environment, such as the [Russian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language) satellite [Kosmos 954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954), which scattered radioactive material over [Northern Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Canada) [(00:06:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=365s).
- The accumulation of orbital debris is a result of decades of space exploration, and it is essential to start cleaning up space to prevent a catastrophic outcome and ensure the continued use of space for satellites and future missions [(00:01:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=89s).

## Origins and Accumulation of Space Debris
- The demise of a Russian satellite in [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) during the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War) led to the realization that [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) could pose a potential danger to the population on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), and it was noted that launching satellites into orbit also creates debris, with each rocket launch leaving behind debris in orbit [(00:07:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=457s).
- The [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) engineer, Rig Gayen, has analyzed the orbital debris created by rocket launches, and it has been found that the upper stages of a rocket, along with fuel tanks and nose cones, are systematically left in orbit, contributing to the accumulation of debris over the last 60 years [(00:08:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=510s).
- Space debris comes mainly from satellites that have been put in space and have stopped working, with historically most being left in orbit unless they are placed in a very low orbit, in which case they fall into the Earth's atmosphere, where they are mostly destroyed due to the heat generated by their high speed [(00:09:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=574s).
- However, problems arise when debris does not burn up completely in the atmosphere, and there have been instances of rocket parts crashing to Earth, such as a 550lb fuel tank in [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas) in 1997, and a nose cone in [Martinique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique) in 2011 [(00:10:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=627s).
- The estimated number of objects orbiting the Earth is around 36,000, with an additional 30,000 objects that have already fallen back to Earth, and the total mass of artificial objects in space, including satellites and debris, is approximately 9,000 tons [(00:11:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=703s).

## Satellite Orbits and Debris Distribution
- Satellites around the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) use three different orbits, with the furthest being the geostationary orbit, a thin layer 22,000 miles away, where satellites remain constantly above the same point on the Earth [(00:13:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=798s).
- Satellites in geostationary orbit, which provide telecommunications, computer link-ups, and television broadcasts, are spaced approximately 40 meters apart and need to be removed when they have served their time, with their last fuel reserves used to deorbit them to a graveyard orbit, [(00:13:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=817s).
- Medium Earth orbit, situated between 1,200 and 22,000 miles in altitude, is avoided due to the presence of radio navigation satellites like Galileo, and if one of these satellites breaks down, it is placed into an intermediate orbit to prevent interference, [(00:14:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=872s).
- [Low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit), the closest orbit to Earth, is situated below 1,200 miles in altitude and has accumulated the most debris over the past 60 years, with the only way to get rid of debris in this area being to send it into Earth's atmosphere where it disintegrates, [(00:14:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=898s).

## Satellite Malfunctions and Solar Flares
- Satellites can re-enter Earth's atmosphere with almost no risk in certain areas, such as the South Pacific, and if a satellite still has fuel, it is possible to control its movements in low, medium, and geostationary orbits, [(00:15:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=931s).
- Satellites can break down without warning, and the cause of these malfunctions is often due to natural interference with safety measures, such as solar storms, which can release huge amounts of energy and electrically charged particles into space, [(00:16:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=971s).
- Solar flares can wipe out navigation systems and destroy satellites, with an estimated dozen or so satellites being destroyed each year, turning them into [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), [(00:16:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1013s).

## The Kessler Syndrome and Collision Risks
- Space debris poses two problems: it can stay in orbit for a long time, such as 1,000 to 2,000 years, and it can move at high speeds, increasing the probability of crashing into something, [(00:17:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1075s).
- The situation with space debris has degenerated since 2007, with three major events causing an increase in debris, including the collision between the [Russian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language) satellite [Kosmos 2251](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_2251) and the American satellite [Iridium 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_33), which produced around 2,000 pieces of debris larger than 3 inches, [(00:18:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1112s).
- The collision of out-of-control objects in low orbit poses a significant danger to working satellites, as demonstrated by China's deliberate destruction of a weather satellite using a ballistic missile, which was followed by Russia's destruction of a decommissioned satellite called [Kosmos 148](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_148), resulting in 1500 pieces of large debris being scattered into low orbit [(00:19:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1190s).
- The events caused by the [Chinese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language) and Russian governments destroying satellites on purpose have highlighted the risk of collision to satellites in space, with over a million pieces of debris larger than half an inch now circling the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), including pieces from rockets and their fuel tanks [(00:21:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1289s).
- The fuel tanks of rockets can explode when liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen mix, producing nitrous oxide and creating thousands of pieces of debris that remain in orbit, contributing to the proliferation of space junk [(00:21:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1310s).
- This phenomenon is known as [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome), named after [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) consultant [Donald J. Kessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler), who described and quantified it, predicting that collisions between objects in Earth's orbit would have a cascading effect, increasing the likelihood of further collisions [(00:22:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1361s).
- Don Kessler's theory was proven accurate in 1996 when debris from an Ariane rocket launched 10 years earlier collided with a [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) military satellite, causing damage and demonstrating the potential for a chain reaction of collisions in space [(00:24:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1456s).

## Consequences of Space Debris Proliferation
- The proliferation of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) could endanger a wide range of activities on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), including satellite positioning, which is used in daily life for navigation and other purposes, highlighting the need for innovative solutions to address the issue of orbital waste [(00:25:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1511s).
- The proliferation of debris in space risks compromising satellite services, and space agencies have to take serious risks when launching satellites, including the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency), due to the possibility of conjunctions with objects [(00:25:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1559s).
- The risk of losing a satellite is now proven and quantified, with the odds of losing a satellite being 5%, part of which is the risk of being hit by debris, and the likelihood can quickly reach 10 or 20% with the increase in orbital debris [(00:26:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1614s).
- The European Space Agency estimates that the risk of collision will rise to 20% by 2038, meaning one out of every five satellites would not complete its mission, which is a huge figure [(00:27:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1637s).

## Space Surveillance and Collision Avoidance
- Space agencies have had to look at ways of negotiating this minefield and detecting the circling waste, with the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) using a space surveillance network since 1957 to predict where and when [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) will enter the Earth's atmosphere [(00:27:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1661s).
- The United States has established a catalog of the debris that is currently in orbit and uses this to determine which country owns the debris that is entering the atmosphere, and they can also warn [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) if debris is at risk of interfering with their satellites [(00:27:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1676s).
- In [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), a similar space surveillance system was not put in place until 40 years later in 1996, when the [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) Ministry of Defense created a system known as GRA, which is a space surveillance network that allows detecting objects that orbit around 250 to 600 m in altitude [(00:28:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1725s).
- The GRA system uses a particular radar that makes real-time calculations to follow and anticipate the trajectories of thousands of satellites, and it was able to detect 30 or so [Chinese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language) and American spy satellites that had not been cataloged previously [(00:29:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1746s).
- International relations in space are a mixture and an extension of those on the ground, with France agreeing to keep quiet about the spy satellites in return for access to the American orbital catalog, which is considerably more detailed than the European version [(00:29:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1795s).
- This constant space surveillance is efficient and allows civilian and military satellites to avoid collisions with orbital debris, with ground-based operators able to move their satellites slightly out of their orbit if there is a risk [(00:30:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1826s).

## Protecting the International Space Station
- The [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) is threatened by debris several times a year, and to avoid orbital collisions, it has to be moved from its course, as seen in 2012 when it avoided a piece of debris from the collision between the Iridium and Cosmos satellites [(00:30:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1854s).
- The space station is on a collision course with small pieces of space junk, and astronauts have to take it into a high orbit by turning on the engines for 37 seconds, which is the only time they can feel acceleration on board [(00:32:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1945s).
- Sometimes, the ballistic data about debris is imprecise, and the astronauts are told to evacuate the station urgently, taking refuge in the Escape module, which could be separated from the station and return the astronauts to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) [(00:33:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1990s).
- There are around 150 million pieces of junk that are too small to be tracked by radars, and satellites and the space station need to be protected from this menace [(00:33:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2028s).

## Shielding Satellites and Astronauts from Debris
- Scientists from the [Fraunhofer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_Society) in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) test shielding material using a super-fast accelerator known as a space gun, which fires tiny metal balls at various shielding materials to reproduce conditions in space [(00:34:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2049s).
- The space gun fires the balls at speeds of up to 15,000 mph, which is necessary to study the behavior of collisions at hyper-velocity speeds, where the impact creates different physical phenomena than at lower speeds [(00:34:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2076s).
- The tests on different satellite components, such as space solar cells and tanks, are analyzed to understand and model what happens during a collision, allowing the team to come up with structures that are both light and resistant to hypervelocity impacts [(00:36:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2179s).
- The Space Gun team has found that doubling or tripling insulation layers can protect satellite components hit by debris smaller than 4 inches, with the first layer fragmenting the debris, the second dissipating its energy, and the third protecting the component [(00:37:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2220s).
- Scientists have been able to design satellites that are resistant to small debris thanks to experiments, but astronauts remain exposed to small debris during space walks, which can't be detected by Radars or seen by the human eye, and even a minor impact would puncture an astronaut's suit and lead to instant death [(00:37:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2269s).
- [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) is actively developing robots that could replace humans to accomplish maintenance operations outside the spacecraft, though even robots would be unable to withstand a collision with debris of more than half an inch [(00:38:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2304s).

## Mitigation Efforts and International Regulations
- Countries around the world have tried to establish rules for the nonproliferation of large debris, such as emptying all fuel on board their space vehicles and limiting satellites to a maximum 25-year lifespan in orbit [(00:38:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2325s).
- Satellites are equipped with systems to vent or burn excess fuel, and objects in **low** **earth** **orbit** that do not completely burn up on re-entry are steered towards broad ocean areas for their final impact, but these rules are not always respected [(00:38:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2339s).

## Cleaning Up Space: The Rise of Space Garbage Collectors
- The amount of junk in space is increasing, and we're generating debris faster than it can be cleaned out by the atmosphere, creating an unsustainable environment, and the only real solution to this problem is to clean out the debris that is orbiting around the earth [(00:39:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2390s).
- Based on the Polla pay principle, each country is supposed to finance the elimination of its own debris, and since 2013, Space Engineers have been creating a new profession, space garbage collectors, who come up with robotic systems that can deal with large pieces of garbage [(00:40:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2417s).
- Researchers are working on robot satellites that could capture debris and deorbit it, such as the Remove Debris project at the space center in England, which is testing technologies like the [Harpoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpoon), a system capable of attaching onto a piece of debris and dragging it into the atmosphere [(00:41:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2464s).
- The team is still at the experimental stage, testing a miniature harpoon on a stationary target, and the first full-scale test in space in 2019 was a success, with hopes that the system will improve when it goes into space due to the lack of gravity [(00:42:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2548s).
- The first full-scale tests in space for improving systems will take place in 2020, and one of the tools envisioned is the Harpoon, but the [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa) space agency has also come up with its own cleaning solutions, including a project called [Medusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa), which is a small satellite capable of unfolding its tentacles to capture debris [(00:42:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2574s).
- Medusa will enclose the debris and drag it to where it needs to be, either to a grave orbit or to decrease its altitude and eventually toss the debris back into the atmosphere, and one of the advantages of the Medusa satellites is that they can be launched in squadrons, which keeps costs down [(00:43:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2585s).
- Medusa is designed to be put onto [CubeSat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat), which are small multi-use satellites in the shape of a 4in cube, developed by Californian University, and dozens of them can be launched at a time, making it a cost-effective solution for researchers [(00:43:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2629s).
- The Medusa satellite is very light, weighing about 175g, and is designed to eliminate debris over a long period, but it only targets small space junk, and for large non-functioning satellites, other tools are necessary, which opens up the problem of financing these operations [(00:43:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2631s).

## Tackling Large Debris: The Case of Envisat
- One of the largest non-operational pieces of debris is the [Envisat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envisat) observation satellite, which was launched in 2002 by the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) and is the size of a bus, but after losing control of it in 2012, it is now a ticking time bomb as it crosses paths with many other working satellites [(00:45:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2731s).
- The European Space Agency is funding an ambitious program to try and remove Envisat from its orbit, and one of the options being considered is throwing a net, which would allow for a connection by a tether and the captured satellite to be pulled, and to test this, space engineers are using an aircraft to recreate space's zero gravity conditions [(00:47:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2826s).
- The tests have proved that adding weight to the corners of the net allows it to enclose the body of a satellite without snagging on its fragile solar panels, and the net is being designed to catch an 8-ton satellite like Envisat [(00:47:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2850s).
- A tractor satellite is needed to retrieve Envisat, an 8-ton satellite, and return it to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), which is a challenging task due to the satellite's heavy weight, requiring a more stable scenario by pulling rather than pushing [(00:48:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2895s).
- The project to remove Envisat is still in the theoretical stages, with an estimated cost of half a billion euros, and no robot garbage collector is currently ready for the task [(00:48:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2929s).

## Space Tugs: A Promising Solution for Debris Removal
- Space tugs are being considered as a promising solution, which would be multi-functional, acting as a space-based Swiss army knife, capable of refilling, repairing, inspecting, and maintaining satellites, as well as collecting space junk [(00:49:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2961s).
- However, technological problems remain, such as developing autonomous technologies that can manage scheduled rendezvous with targets that have not been designed for this purpose, like old satellites or [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) [(00:50:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3001s).
- The space tug project is still being studied, but with major funding, the first efficient cleaning service may come into use by 2025, with the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) and private companies like One Web already investing in the project [(00:50:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3044s).

## Mega Constellations and the Future of Space Debris
- Private companies are launching thousands of satellites into **low** **Earth** **orbit** to create [Satellite internet constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_internet_constellation), such as SpaceX's [Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) and One Web, aiming to provide internet access to remote parts of the globe [(00:51:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3063s).
- The number of Mega constellation satellites in orbit is expected to exceed the number of satellites launched since the beginning of the Space Race, raising concerns among space specialists about the potential risks and consequences [(00:52:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3125s).
- By 2030, it is estimated that there will be around 100,000 new satellites in orbit, with companies like [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX) and One Web planning to launch thousands of satellites, which requires careful consideration of the potential implications [(00:52:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3154s).

## The Need for Space Traffic Management and Regulation
- The regulatory environment for space needs to be established to ensure the long-term use of space for Humanity, considering deorbit operations and the imposition of a space traffic system, similar to the one in Aviation, to prevent space from being filled with more garbage [(00:52:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3170s).
- [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) is a significant concern, as satellites can break down and circle around as junk, and the lack of international regulations in place poses a problem, especially with the increasing number of satellites being sent into space [(00:53:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3205s).
- The absence of a global body to regulate space debris is a concern, as different groups and countries have varying thoughts on regulation, but no concrete actions have been taken to address the issue [(00:54:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3270s).
- The future of the space industry is promising, but the state of space orbits is worrying, with more players, including smaller nations and private companies, putting satellites into orbit, increasing the risk of orbital debris [(00:54:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3290s).
- Satellite operators are concerned about orbital debris, and although few people on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) are aware of the problem, it could soon have a significant impact on daily life, highlighting the need for a solution, such as the "Polla pays" rule, to be applied to space [(00:55:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3311s).
- The lack of control and management of satellites during the deorbit phase is a concern, and the increasing number of satellites in space, including mega constellation satellites, poses a risk of failures and additional space debris [(00:53:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3229s).

## The Growing Problem of Space Debris
- Mankind has sent thousands of satellites into orbit around the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) since the beginning of space exploration, with satellites being crucial in daily lives, but each launch also jettisons debris into orbit [(00:00:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=27s).
- The accumulation of waste in space has become a significant problem, with the situation close to running out of control, and the generation of debris happening faster than it can be cleaned out by the atmosphere [(00:00:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=52s).
- The debris poses a danger to all other satellites and future space missions, with nearly a million objects larger than half an inch having been counted, and being struck by orbital debris is a constant threat for all satellites [(00:03:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=204s).
- Satellites undertake precise missions, such as photographing the Earth, establishing weather forecasts, relaying signals, and spying on other countries, but they can break down or stop working when they run out of power, becoming orbital debris [(00:02:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=147s).

## The Origins of Space Debris
- The problem of orbital debris began 60 years ago, at the end of the 1950s, when the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) launched [Sputnik 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1), the world's first satellite, which stopped working after 21 days and became a non-functioning artificial object, or orbital debris [(00:04:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=271s).
- The launch of Sputnik triggered the space race, with the Americans creating [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) to catch up with the Soviets, and the Soviets launching spy satellites fueled by nuclear reactors, some of which were defective and posed a risk to the environment [(00:05:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=324s).
- One such incident occurred in 1977, when the [Russian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language) satellite [Kosmos 954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954), fueled by a nuclear reactor, was lost, and scattered radioactive material all over [Northern Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Canada) when it re-entered the atmosphere [(00:06:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=391s).
- The incident highlighted the risks of orbital debris and the need for space cleanup, with rocket scientist Christoph Bernal noting that the problem started at the same time as the first launch of Sputnik on October 4th, 1957 [(00:04:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=260s).

## The Dangers of Space Debris
- Space debris poses a potential danger to the population on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), and it is not the only danger, as launching satellites into orbit also creates debris, with each rocket launch leaving debris in orbit [(00:08:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=490s).
- The situation of space debris has led to the current state, where old satellites have stayed in orbit, and the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) engineer Radica Yin has analyzed the orbital debris created by rocket launches, which includes the upper stages of a rocket, fuel tanks, and other objects that are systematically left in orbit [(00:08:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=539s).
- Over the last 60 years, much of the debris has accumulated, while some has disintegrated, and space scientists like Noelia Sanchez Ortiz analyze the circumstances and destiny of orbital debris, which can remain in orbit unless it is very low and slowly falls down into the Earth [(00:09:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=564s).
- Debris at low altitude moves at speeds of 18,000 miles an hour, but the Earth's atmosphere gradually slows it down, and when pieces eventually fall to Earth, they are mostly destroyed, with the air molecules being compressed by the speed, creating heat and eventually combustion, causing the pieces to break up [(00:09:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=591s).
- Problems arise when debris does not burn up completely in the atmosphere, and there have been instances where debris has crashed into the Earth, such as the 550-pound fuel tank of a [Delta II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_II) rocket that crashed near [Georgetown, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown,_Texas) in [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas) in 1997 [(00:10:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=637s).
- Orbital debris poses a threat to the Earth's population, and it is now cataloged and the risk evaluated, with over 20,000 objects tracked, and while most of them remain in orbit, a minor portion comes down to the Earth and re-enters [(00:11:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=696s).
- The mass of all satellites and debris in orbit represents a mass of 7,500 tons, which is equivalent to the mass of the [Eiffel Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower), and while it may seem like a significant amount, it is spread out in a vast area, making it more like a cloud of dust [(00:12:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=737s).

## Satellite Orbits and Debris Accumulation
- Satellites around the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) use three different orbits, with the furthest being the geostationary orbit, a thin layer 22,000 miles away, where satellites remain constantly above the same point on the equator, providing telecommunications, telephone, and computer link-ups, and television broadcasts [(00:13:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=791s).
- Satellites need to be removed when they have served their time, and their last fuel reserves are used to de-orbit them to another area, such as a graveyard orbit, where they will not interfere with anything below geostationary orbit [(00:13:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=837s).
- Medium Earth orbit is situated between 22,000 and 1,200 miles in altitude, and is occupied by radio navigation satellites like GPS, which are placed into an intermediate orbit if they break down to avoid interference with other satellites [(00:14:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=864s).
- [Low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit), situated below 1,200 miles in altitude, is where the last 60 years of space exploration has left the most debris, and the only way to get rid of debris in this area is to send it into Earth's atmosphere where it disintegrates [(00:14:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=891s).
- There are areas on Earth, such as the South Pacific, where objects can re-enter with almost no risk due to their distance from populations, and large objects are often re-entered in these areas [(00:15:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=923s).

## Causes of Satellite Malfunctions and Debris Generation
- Satellites can be controlled and moved out of the way if they still have fuel, but some satellites can still malfunction and become out of control, even if they have fuel, and the cause of these malfunctions is often unknown [(00:15:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=943s).
- Solar flares can cause malfunctions in satellites by releasing huge amounts of energy and electrically charged particles into space, which can wipe out navigation systems and turn satellites into orbital debris [(00:16:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1004s).
- Space is an infinite empty space with some junk and debris moving about, posing two significant problems: objects can stay in orbit for a long time, and they are moving at high speeds, increasing the probability of crashing into something [(00:17:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1068s).
- The situation with space debris has degenerated since 2007, with two significant events, including the collision between [Kosmos 2251](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_2251), a [Russian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language) satellite, and [Iridium 33](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_33), an [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) satellite, which sent deadly fragments flying in all directions and posed a threat to devices in **low** **Earth** **orbit** [(00:18:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1107s).
- Another event that contributed to the increase in space debris was when [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) deliberately destroyed a weather satellite, which added to the already significant amount of junk in space [(00:19:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1190s).
- The [Chinese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language) authorities demonstrated their strength by using a ballistic missile armed with an infrared seeker and a warhead, which was an arrogant show of strength with no concern for the consequences [(00:20:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1216s).
- As a result of this event and another, by 2010, there were more than 17,000 large pieces of debris circling the earth, including pieces from satellites and rockets, with some of the debris coming from the fuel tank of a normal rocket [(00:20:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1240s).

## Kessler Syndrome and the Cascading Effect of Collisions
- The fuel tank of a rocket contains liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, which can mix and explode, creating a thousand pieces of debris that remain in orbit, and this phenomenon is known as [Donald J. Kessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler) syndrome, named after the [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) consultant who described and quantified it [(00:21:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1267s).
- Don Kessler proposed the scenario of [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome) back in 1978, predicting that collisions would have a cascading effect, increasing the likelihood of further collisions, and this theory was proven accurate in 1996 when debris from an [Ariane (rocket family)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_(rocket_family)) rocket knocked out a French military satellite [(00:22:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1326s).
- The proliferation of debris risks compromising today's constantly diversifying satellite services, which are a major part of our daily lives, including telecommunications, banking, and GPS systems, and space agencies have to take serious risks each time they launch [(00:24:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1498s).
- The issue of space debris is a serious concern, as it can damage spacecraft and produce a spray of particles that can travel fast and cause further damage, and the cascading effect of collisions can lead to a slow but steady increase in the amount of debris in orbit [(00:22:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1375s).
- The problem of space debris is likened to a pandemic, as it proliferates and risks creating even more debris, and it is expected that every 10 years, two objects will collide and create a major breakup, and every five years, collisions between large objects and fragments will produce more debris [(00:21:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1287s).
- Launching satellites despite the possibility of conjunctions with objects is a risk that has been proven and quantified, with the odds of losing a satellite being around five percent, partly due to the risk of being hit by debris [(00:25:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1546s).
- The likelihood of losing a satellite can quickly reach 10 or 20 percent with the increase in orbital debris, and the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) estimates that the risk of collision will rise to 20 percent by 2038 [(00:26:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1576s).

## Space Surveillance and Collision Avoidance
- Space agencies have had to look at ways of negotiating this problem and detecting the circling waste, with the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) using a space surveillance network since 1957 to predict where and when orbital debris will enter the Earth's atmosphere [(00:26:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1601s).
- The system has been refined and computerized over time, and it uses a catalog of debris to determine which country owns the debris that is entering the atmosphere and to warn [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) if debris is at risk of interfering with their satellites [(00:26:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1614s).
- In [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), a similar space surveillance system was not put in place until 40 years later, in 1996, when debris from the [Ariane (rocket family)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_(rocket_family)) rocket damaged the military satellite [Cerise (satellite)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerise_(satellite)), and the French Ministry of Defense created a system known as [Grave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave) [(00:27:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1657s).
- The Grave system uses a particular radar to make real-time calculations and follow the trajectories of thousands of satellites, and it was able to detect 30 or so [Chinese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language) and American spy satellites that had not been cataloged previously [(00:28:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1685s).
- International relations in space are a mixture of mutual aid and competition, and [France](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) agreed to keep quiet about the spy satellites in return for access to the American orbital debris catalog, which is more detailed than the European version [(00:28:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1734s).
- The constant space surveillance is efficient and allows civilian and military satellites to avoid collisions with orbital debris, and ground-based operators can move their satellites slightly out of their orbit if there is a risk [(00:29:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1766s).
- The [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) is threatened by debris several times a year and has to be moved from its course to avoid orbital debris with an identified trajectory, and this constant threat has become part of the astronauts' daily lives [(00:30:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1836s).
- The International Space Station (ISS) has to take evasive action when debris is detected, which involves turning on the engines for 37 seconds to move into a higher orbit, and this is the only time when acceleration can be felt on board, making the astronauts no longer weightless as they are pushed backwards by the engines [(00:31:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1884s).
- If the ballistic data about debris is imprecise, no risks are taken, and the astronauts are told to evacuate the station urgently, taking refuge in the Escape module, which can be separated from the station and return the astronauts to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) [(00:32:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1928s).
- Evacuation is not necessary every time, as frequently, orbital debris is not detected if it is smaller than four inches, and nowadays, there are millions of pieces of junk that are too small to be followed by radars [(00:32:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1963s).

## Protecting Spacecraft from Debris Impacts
- To avoid the menace of space debris, satellites and the space station need to be protected, and scientists from the [Fraunhofer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_Society) in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) are testing shielding materials using a super-fast accelerator known as a space gun [(00:33:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1985s).
- The space gun fires tiny metal balls at various shielding materials to reproduce conditions in space, and the behavior of collisions at hypervelocity speeds is very different from that on Earth, with a one millimeter ball having more energy than a baseball flying at 60 miles an hour [(00:33:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2014s).
- The results of these tests on different satellite components are analyzed, and the scientists have been able to design satellites that are resistant to small debris, but even today, astronauts remain exposed to small debris when they are outside their vehicles during spacewalks [(00:35:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2125s).
- [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) is actively developing robots that could replace humans to accomplish maintenance operations outside the spacecraft, as even a minor impact from small debris could puncture an astronaut's suit and lead to instant death, and robots would also be unable to withstand a collision with debris of more than half an inch [(00:37:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2229s).

## Mitigation Efforts and International Cooperation
- Cultures around the world have tried to establish rules for the non-proliferation of large debris, such as emptying fuel on board space vehicles and venting or burning excess fuel, with satellites limited to a maximum 25-year lifespan in orbit [(00:37:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2261s).
- Objects in **low** **earth** **orbit** that do not completely burn up on re-entry are steered towards broad ocean areas for their final impact, but these rules are not always respected due to the lack of a governing body to police offenders [(00:38:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2296s).
- The amount of junk in space increases over time, generating debris faster than it can be cleaned out by the atmosphere, creating an unsustainable environment [(00:38:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2320s).
- The only real solution to this problem is to clean out the debris that is orbiting around the earth, which involves bringing back some of the objects that have been left in orbit, with each country supposed to finance the elimination of its own debris based on the polluter pays principle [(00:39:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2340s).

## Developing Solutions for Space Debris Removal
- Space Engineers have been creating a new profession, the "space garbage guy", to come up with robotic systems that can deal with large pieces of garbage by sending them into the Earth's atmosphere [(00:39:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2361s).
- Laboratories around the world, such as the Surrey Space Center in England, have been working on robot satellites that can capture debris and deorbit it, with projects like the Remove Debris project [(00:40:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2400s).
- One of the technologies being developed is the harpoon, which is designed to attach onto a piece of debris and drag it into the atmosphere, with the team currently testing a miniature harpoon on a stationary target [(00:40:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2426s).
- Another solution being developed is the [Medusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa) satellite, created by the [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa) space agency, which can unfold its tentacles to capture debris and drag it to where it needs to be, either to a [Grave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave) orbit or to decrease its altitude and let it burn up in the atmosphere [(00:42:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2524s).
- The development of these solutions is a long process, with the first full-scale tests in space scheduled to take place in 2020, and the team is improving its system through a trial and error method [(00:41:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2514s).
- Satellites can be launched directly from the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station), and a device called Medusa, which weighs about 175 grams, is designed to be put onto cubesats, small multi-use satellites in the shape of a four-inch cube, to eliminate debris over a 25-year period [(00:42:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2566s).
- Medusa allows for multiple attempts to remove small targets, but it only targets small space junk, and other tools are necessary for large non-functioning satellites, which opens up the problem of financing these operations [(00:43:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2627s).
- The largest non-operational piece of space debris is [Envisat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envisat), an observation satellite the size of a bus launched by the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) in 2002, which was supposed to be deorbited after five years but is now a ticking time bomb as it crosses paths with many other working satellites [(00:44:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2671s).
- The European Space Agency is funding an ambitious program to try and remove Envisat from its orbit, and one option being considered is throwing a net to capture the satellite, which would be pulled by a tether [(00:46:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2765s).
- To test this space net, engineers use an aircraft to recreate space's zero gravity conditions, and tests have shown that adding weight to the corners of the net allows it to enclose the body of a satellite without snagging on its fragile solar panels [(00:46:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2789s).
- The project to remove Envisat is still in the theoretical stages due to the high cost, estimated at half a billion euros, and no robot garbage collector is ready for work at this time [(00:47:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2865s).

## Space Tugs and Autonomous Technologies
- The cleanup operation for space debris would need to be free, similar to a passenger on another mission, and one promising solution is the use of space tugs, which are multifunctional and can perform various tasks such as refilling, repairing, and inspecting satellites, as well as gathering space junk and sending it into the atmosphere [(00:48:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2891s).
- Space tugs are being developed by Airbus Engineers, but technological problems remain, including the inability to perform a scheduled rendezvous with a target that has not been designed for this purpose, such as an old satellite or piece of orbital debris [(00:48:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2932s).
- To overcome this, new autonomous technologies need to be developed, based on vision sensors that can scan the environment, analyze images, and detect and manipulate objects, allowing space tugs to manage on their own [(00:49:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2955s).
- The Space Tag project is still being studied, but thanks to major funding, the first efficient cleaning service may come into use by 2025, and other ambitious startups, such as [Eutelsat OneWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutelsat_OneWeb), are also working on launching thousands of satellites into **low** **Earth** **orbit** to create a network for broadband internet [(00:49:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2981s).

## Mega Constellations and the Need for Regulation
- The launch of [Satellite internet constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_internet_constellation), such as OneWeb's, which will have 882 satellites, is a source of concern for orbital debris specialists, as it will significantly increase the amount of space debris, and there are many other Mega constellations being proposed, including those by [Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing) and [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX) [(00:51:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3062s).
- The promoters of these projects maintain that they have taken necessary precautions, but there is a need for a regulatory environment to ensure that deorbiting and operations are done in a manner consistent with long-term use of space for humanity [(00:51:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3105s).
- There is a danger that space will be filled with even more garbage if there are failures, and satellites break down, and international regulations are urgently required to avoid an orbital debris pandemic [(00:52:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3120s).
- Most people engaged in space exploration are advocating for regulations, but there is currently no global body that regulates space debris, and it is a concern that different groups are thinking about regulating it in different ways [(00:52:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3153s).
- Countries have varying thoughts about regulation, but a concrete solution is needed to address the issue of space debris, which could potentially come from the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) through legislation [(00:52:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3168s).
- The United Nations may need to force countries to get involved in cleaning up space debris, as the problem is a major concern for satellite operators, and the "polluter pays" rule has not yet been applied [(00:52:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3176s).
- The issue of orbital debris is a significant problem that could have severe consequences, and although it is not widely known, it has the potential to impact people's lives in the future [(00:53:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3189s).

# Space is Full of Junk. Here’s How to Clean It Up…
![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uJcXCdbm77g/maxresdefault.jpg)



## The Growing Crisis of Space Junk
- On February 10th, 2009, a [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) military satellite collided with an [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) communication satellite above [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia), creating thousands of pieces of debris and highlighting the worsening crisis of space junk [(00:00:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=7s).
- The collision, which occurred at a speed of nearly 36,000 kmph, was the biggest [Satellite collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_collision) in history and an eye-opening warning about the crisis of space junk, with debris from the collision remaining in orbit along with millions of other human-made objects [(00:00:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=14s).
- The crisis of space junk is a significant problem, with near [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) orbits littered with dead satellites, rocket parts, lost tools, and countless unknown objects, threatening the ability to launch new satellites or space stations into orbit [(00:01:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=72s).
- Experts fear that the crisis could mean the end of space exploration, which is still in its infancy, and a team of engineers has developed a solution called [ClearSpace-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearSpace-1), a claw designed to collect space junk, due to launch in 2026 [(00:01:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=96s).

## The Increasing Volume of Space Debris
- The number of objects in orbit has increased exponentially since the first satellite launch in 1957, especially in recent years with the advent of smaller, cheaper satellites and reusable rocket technology [(00:02:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=146s).
- The most crowded orbital highway is the low Earth orbit, which ranges from 160 to 2,000 km above the Earth's surface and is home to many scientific satellites, space internet constellations, and the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) [(00:02:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=173s).

## Clear Space One: A Solution for Space Junk Removal
- The [ClearSpace-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearSpace-1) mission, led by engineer Muriel Richard, aims to use a large claw to grab a discarded rocket fragment and bring it back to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), providing a potential solution to the space junk crisis [(00:02:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=162s).
- The orbital altitude of an object determines how long it stays in orbit, with lower orbits decaying more quickly due to atmospheric drag, and objects launched below 500 km will naturally decay and fall back to Earth within a few years [(00:03:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=221s).
- The Clear Space One mission aims to collect a satellite fragment currently orbiting near a certain altitude, with the satellite launched at 700 km altitude, and the goal is to clear space junk at higher orbital altitudes like geosynchronous orbits [(00:04:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=275s).

## The Dangers of Space Debris and the Kessler Syndrome
- Objects in orbit around the Earth can survive essentially indefinitely, but their orbits can overlap and collide with other objects, resulting in immense energy and damage, with even small space junk having the potential to cause major damage to active satellites and space stations [(00:04:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=292s).
- The problem of space junk has been highlighted by Don Kesler, who warns that at the current rate of launches and space activity, the amount of junk in space will eventually turn into an exponential problem, known as the [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome), where collisions create hundreds or thousands of new pieces, increasing the risk of further collisions [(00:06:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=362s).

## Mitigating the Space Junk Problem
- The [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) already has to take evasive maneuvers to avoid space junk multiple times a year, and [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) has canceled spacewalks due to debris, but the [ClearSpace-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearSpace-1) robot could be a solution to this problem, with its ability to grab and remove space junk using a claw robot [(00:06:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=414s).
- The Clear Space One robot is being trained using machine learning to see, find, and grab its target, a nose cone left over from the satellite deployment process, with the goal of being able to operate nearly free of human intervention, using an array of cameras to navigate and identify its target [(00:07:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=458s).
- The robot's computer vision system has to be trained to interpret complex scenes, including high contrast and tumbling objects, in order to accurately identify and grab the target, with the team generating realistic images of the target to help train the system [(00:07:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=473s).

## Challenges in Capturing Space Junk
- Researchers are working on training robots to capture space junk, with one of the main challenges being to grab the object without the robot spinning off in the opposite direction, and they are considering using tentacles, which are inspired by the way humans catch a ball, [(00:08:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=521s).
- The tentacles are designed to close around the object before it hits, allowing the robot to grip it securely, and this approach is necessary because in space, gravity is not present to help keep the object in place, [(00:08:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=523s).
- To capture space junk, the robot needs to match both the velocity and rotation of the object, which is a complex task, especially since space junk is often spinning, and the robot must move at the exact same speed as the junk before deploying the tentacles, [(00:08:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=527s).
- The baseline of the operation is to achieve motion synchronization, where the robot moves with the target object, making the relative movement between them zero, which makes the capture easier, and this requires advanced algorithms to track and process the movement of the object, [(00:08:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=534s).
- The goal of this mission is not only to capture space junk but also to ensure that the robot does not become space junk itself, and to achieve this, researchers are working on developing algorithms that can reconstruct complex movements and track objects in space, [(00:09:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=541s).

## A Multi-Faceted Approach to Space Junk Removal
- Cleaning up space junk is a complex task that will require a multi-faceted approach, including the development of fleets of space garbage sweepers and tow trucks, and other research teams are working on solutions such as magnetically docking repair bots to fix broken satellites and prolong their mission life, [(00:09:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=551s).
- Experts agree that cleaning up space junk is not enough, and that it is also necessary to stop putting new space junk into orbit and to plan the full lifespan of every object put into space, which is a difficult challenge due to the treaties around space launches that designate space as a common area under no individual country's law, [(00:09:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=586s).
- The ultimate goal is to change our relationship with space and how we keep it clean, and to achieve this, it will be necessary to develop new technologies and strategies for managing space junk, and to work together internationally to address this global problem, [(00:10:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=605s).

## Crowding of Polar Orbits
- Polar orbits are crowded due to the positioning that allows satellites to obtain a complete picture of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) [(00:12:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=758s)
- The crowding of polar orbits is a result of the benefits they provide, including the ability to gather comprehensive data [(00:12:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=761s)
- Satellites in polar orbits can capture a complete view of the Earth, which is useful for various purposes, including tracking objects or monitoring the environment [(00:12:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=765s)

## Off-Topic Comments
- The reference to Santa hiding his presence until [Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas) is a humorous anecdote, but it does not provide any significant information about space junk or cleaning it up [(00:12:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=769s)
- The topic of space junk and cleaning it up is not directly addressed in this segment, which appears to be a lighthearted and unrelated comment [(00:12:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcXCdbm77g&t=774s)

# Space debris: A problem that’s only getting bigger
![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eeQnv_IWttw/maxresdefault.jpg)


- There are currently over 128 million objects larger than a millimeter orbiting the earth, transforming the space around it into a junkyard, and even a small piece of cosmic junk traveling at high speeds can be catastrophic to many satellites [(00:00:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=18s).
- The number of satellites in earth's orbit has increased drastically over the past few years, with over 11,400 satellites launched, and only 3,370 of them are currently active, while the rest are inactively floating in orbit [(00:00:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=51s).
- Several companies, including [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX), [Amazon (company)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)), and China's Hongyan, are planning to launch thousands of satellites into the earth's orbit, which can lead to a disaster and increase the chances of collisions between high-speed objects [(00:01:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=91s).
- The first documented collision involving [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) happened in 1996, and in 2009, a US commercial satellite collided with an inactive Russian communications satellite, creating over 2,300 pieces of space shrapnel [(00:01:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=107s).
- The Kessler syndrome, coined by [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) scientist [Donald J. Kessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler), describes the phenomenon where collisions between high-speed objects in orbit create thousands of pieces of debris, leading to a chain reaction that can make the earth's orbit unusable [(00:02:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=176s).
- To stop the orbital junk generating chain reaction, techniques such as dragging parts of space junk down into the earth's atmosphere or using a net or harpoon to capture space-borne garbage are being developed and tested [(00:03:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=197s).
- The [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) has awarded a contract to a [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) startup to retrieve a 220-pound piece of rocket debris that has been orbiting the earth since 2013, scheduled for 2025, which will utilize four robotic arms to capture the debris [(00:03:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=221s).
- However, these methods are only useful for larger pieces of junk, and there isn't a way to pick up smaller pieces of debris, so all that can be done is wait for them to re-enter the earth's atmosphere naturally [(00:04:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=240s).
- If nothing changes and the amount of debris continues to grow, it will pose a risk to future space missions, and it's only a matter of time before more collisions occur, making it nearly impossible to clean up the low earth orbit [(00:04:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=254s).
- Without innovative solutions, the only option will be to rely on a network of ground and satellite-based observatories to watch and monitor the skies [(00:04:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=273s).

# Managing Orbital Space Debris | Creon Levit
![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nnvHzI3C0ow/maxresdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCIAKENAF8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGHIgUig4MA8=&rs=AOn4CLAf39-8XY21OsYGytPTgPD6b69o2g)



## The Solar Cycle and its Effects on Space Debris
- The sun has a seven-year or 14-year cycle, during which it becomes active and inactive, emitting more radiation at certain wavelengths that can affect the upper atmosphere of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), particularly during [Solar flare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare), [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=0s).
- When the sun is active, it increases the density of the upper atmosphere, causing objects in orbit to be dragged down faster due to increased atmospheric density, which can lead to re-entry and burn-up, [(00:00:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=8s).
- The solar cycle and debris re-entries are related, as when the sun is active, more debris re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, providing some natural cleaning, but not enough to solve the problem of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), [(00:00:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=55s).
- To manage space debris, satellites are designed with restricted lifetimes, and operators are required to dispose of them after a certain number of years, either by re-entering the Earth's atmosphere or moving them to an orbit that does not interfere with other satellites, [(00:01:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=69s).
- Some satellites, like those launched by [Planet Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Labs), are designed to have short lifetimes and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere after a few years, while others, like the billion-dollar NVSAT satellite, which is now a large piece of space junk, require more careful planning for disposal, [(00:02:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=120s).

## Managing Space Debris
- Active debris removal is a proposed solution to remove large dead objects from orbit, as they pose a significant threat of collisions and creating more debris, [(00:02:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=175s).
- To avoid collisions, a traffic management system is necessary, similar to air traffic management, to track the location of all satellites and ensure they follow an orderly pattern to minimize the risk of collisions, [(00:03:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=180s).
- The issue of collisions with a dense [Constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation) of satellites can be mitigated by mapping out their positions in different coordinate systems, allowing for a more organized and efficient use of space [(00:03:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=217s).
- By using mathematical functions to map out the positions of satellites, they can be placed in a grid-like pattern, with each satellite sitting in its own "box", reducing the risk of collisions [(00:03:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=238s).
- The [Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) constellation is an example of this, with satellites that have been launched recently appearing as brightly colored dots, and those that have reached their assigned orbits appearing as pale gray dots [(00:04:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=273s).
- As satellites reach their assigned positions, they slow down and lock into their position, turning gray, and can be seen building up a grid-like pattern [(00:05:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=323s).
- If all satellites stay in their assigned positions, or "boxes", the risk of collisions can be greatly reduced, and a large number of satellites can be safely operated in orbit [(00:05:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=335s).

## Collision Avoidance and Traffic Management
- However, the presence of debris objects that do not follow the same rules and can interfere with operational satellites is a significant challenge [(00:05:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=357s).
- Active debris removal is one possible solution, which could involve using robots or other technologies to capture and remove debris objects from orbit [(00:06:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=368s).
- Satellite servicing and debris removal are similar in that they require proximity to the target object, attachment, and then some form of action, such as refueling or moving the object to a graveyard orbit [(00:06:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=385s).
- One of the challenges of debris removal is that debris objects are often tumbling, making it harder to get a hold of them, and new technologies, such as inflatable balloons, are being proposed as potential solutions [(00:06:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=408s).
- The idea of sending up a net to collect [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) is not feasible because it can create more problems, such as the net getting tangled up with other objects and causing even more debris, or accidentally hitting and damaging other satellites [(00:07:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=425s).
- Schemes like using a net to collect space debris can also be considered as anti-satellite weapons in disguise, as they could potentially be used to remove or disable other satellites [(00:07:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=449s).

## Active Debris Removal and Proposed Solutions
- Another proposed method for removing space debris is using harpoons to catch and drag away the debris, which was considered in a European space mission called e.Deorbit [(00:07:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=473s).
- The e.Deorbit mission was planned to use a satellite to grab a dead environmental satellite, called [Envisat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envisat), and de-boost it into the atmosphere, but the mission was cancelled [(00:07:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=479s).
- Despite the cancellation of the e.Deorbit mission, a new mission called [ClearSpace-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearSpace-1) is scheduled to launch in 2025, which aims to remove a medium-sized piece of junk from orbit at a cost of 86 million euros [(00:08:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=513s).
- The Envisat satellite, which was supposed to be removed by the e.Deorbit mission, is still in orbit, and the ClearSpace mission will target a different piece of debris [(00:08:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=510s).

# Les débris spatiaux
![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WdDcon4zRYo/maxresdefault.jpg)



## Introduction aux débris spatiaux
- Les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) sont un problème sérieux qui pose des défis stratégiques et diplomatiques, et qui a récemment été mis en évidence par un tir anti-satellite russe qui a généré environ 15000 débris, même si le nombre exact est de 1500 débris catalogués pour le moment [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=0s).
- Les débris spatiaux sont des objets ou desbris orbitaux artificiels non fonctionnels qui ne servent à rien, et ils peuvent provenir de diverses sources, notamment les vieux satellites et les lanceurs qui ont atteint leur fin de vie [(00:00:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=10s).
- Les débris spatiaux peuvent causer des problèmes importants pour les engins et les équipages spatiaux, et ils s'ajoutent à une pollution très préoccupante de millions de débris spatiaux qui existent déjà en orbite [(00:00:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=28s).
- Christophe Bonal, chercheur et président de la commission débris spatiaux à la [Fédération aéronautique internationale](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fédération_aéronautique_internationale), est une personne qualifiée pour discuter de ce problème [(00:00:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=42s).

## Historique et exemples de débris spatiaux
- L'exemple de Spoutnik, lancé le 4 octobre 1957, montre que même les premiers satellites ont généré des débris, notamment le bloc de la fusée et la coiffe protectrice, qui ont représenté 98% de la masse du satellite [(00:01:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=106s).
- Les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) peuvent rester en orbite pendant des périodes prolongées, même après que les satellites ont cessé de fonctionner, et ils peuvent continuer à poser une menace pour les engins et les équipages spatiaux [(00:02:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=163s).
- Les débris spatiaux comprennent les étages de lanceur abandonnés et les débris laissés pendant les opérations spatiales, avec des objets catalogués qui peuvent être suivis par radar ou télescope depuis la Terre, avec une taille d'environ 10 cm de diamètre en orbite basse [(00:03:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=188s).

## Objets catalogués et zones encombrées
- Un objet catalogué est un objet qui peut être suivi par radar ou télescope depuis la Terre, avec une taille suffisamment grande pour être détectée, et il y a environ 34 000 gros objets de plus de 10 cm dans l'espace [(00:03:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=191s).
- Les objets catalogués sont suivis par la [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) et sont représentés sur des planches qui montrent les concentrations de débris dans certaines zones, notamment en orbite basse et en orbite géostationnaire [(00:03:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=193s).
- Il y a deux zones très encombrées de [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) : une zone en orbite basse et une zone en orbite géostationnaire, qui est située à 35 786 km au-dessus de l'équateur [(00:03:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=196s).

## Types de débris spatiaux et estimations
- Les satellites géostationnaires abandonnés peuvent dériver sur les effets de la pression de radiation solaire et des perturbations de la Lune et du soleil, et peuvent atteindre une inclinaison de 15 à 17 degrés [(00:03:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=198s).
- Il y a environ 23 000 objets catalogués, mais il y a également des objets qui ne sont pas catalogués, notamment des objets militaires ou des objets qui sont difficiles à suivre [(00:03:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=200s).
- Les objets catalogués comprennent environ 4 000 satellites actifs, et le reste sont des débris spatiaux, avec environ 10 000 objets qui sont difficiles à suivre en raison de leur orientation ou de leur trajectoire [(00:03:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=204s).
- Le catalogue master est un catalogue semi-empirique qui combine des observations et des statistiques pour suivre les objets catalogués, et il y a environ 230 000 objets catalogués dans ce catalogue [(00:03:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=205s).
- Les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) en orbite basse sont un problème croissant, notamment avec les constellations Starling et les orbits NSS, avec environ 8000 tonnes de débris, ce qui équivaut à la masse de la Tour Eiffel, subdivisée en objets de tailles diverses [(00:06:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=379s).
- Il y a environ un million de débris de plus de 1 cm et 150 millions de débris de 1 mm, mais il faut considérer que l'espace est très grand et que ces débris sont dilués dans l'espace, ce qui signifie qu'il y a peu d'objets par unité de volume [(00:06:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=406s).
- Même dans la région la plus dense de l'espace, à 800 km d'altitude, il y a statistiquement un objet par boîte de 100 km sur 100 km sur 1000 km, et le volume occupé par les débris est équivalent à deux bouteilles de [Coca-Cola](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola) dans la Méditerranée [(00:07:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=440s).

## Problèmes posés par les débris spatiaux
- Les débris spatiaux posent trois problèmes : ils se déplacent à vitesse orbitale, ils restent en orbite pendant longtemps, et ils finissent par retomber sur Terre, ce qui présente un risque pour les populations [(00:07:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=474s).

## Évolution de la masse et du nombre de débris
- La masse de débris en orbite a augmenté continuellement depuis 1957, sans signe de diminution, malgré une activité spatiale variable, avec un nombre de vols orbitaux réussis par année qui a varié au fil des ans [(00:08:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=508s).
- L'évolution de la masse de débris en orbite est représentée par une courbe qui montre une augmentation continue, sans réfléchissement, même lorsque le nombre de vols orbitaux a diminué [(00:08:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=520s).
- Le nombre d'objets en orbite a augmenté au fil des années, notamment depuis le lancement de Spoutnik, avec des pics occasionnels dus à des explosions ou des collisions en orbite, comme l'explosion de l'étage supérieur d'[Ariane 1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_1) en 1986 [(00:09:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=578s).

## Accidents et explosions en orbite
- L'explosion de l'étage supérieur d'Ariane 1 a été causée par la présence de carburant à bord, qui s'est échauffé au soleil et a fini par exploser, générant 700 gros débris [(00:10:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=610s).
- Les Américains ont analysé l'incident et ont conseillé de modifier l'étage pour éviter de tels accidents à l'avenir, en ajoutant des vannes pyrotechniques pour évacuer le carburant [(00:10:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=631s).
- Un essai anti-satellite chinois en 2007 a également généré des débris en orbite, avec environ 4000 débris restant en orbite pour environ 200 ans [(00:11:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=687s).
- Les Américains ont également effectué un essai anti-satellite en 2008, avec le satellite [USA-193](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA-193), mais ont pris des précautions pour minimiser les débris générés en effectuant l'opération à une altitude plus basse [(00:11:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=703s).
- Le nombre de débris en orbite continue d'augmenter, avec des collisions et des explosions occasionnelles, comme la collision dont on va reparler plus tard [(00:12:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=735s).

## Contributeurs principaux et répartition des débris
- Les données de la [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) ont été arrêtées au 1er janvier 2021, et il est essentiel de considérer les contributeurs de l'état actuel des [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), notamment les États-Unis, la [Russie](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russie) et la Chine, qui représentent 90 % de la population orbitale [(00:12:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=746s).
- Il y a environ 4000 satellites actifs et 3883 satellites morts en orbite, et la répartition de ces objets montre que les États-Unis, la Russie et la Chine représentent 90 % de la population orbitale, tandis que la [France](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) représente seulement 2,6 % des objets [(00:13:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=794s).
- Les débris spatiaux et les étages supérieurs représentent un problème important, notamment en orbite basse, où la Russie, les États-Unis et la Chine représentent 98 % des objets, et il est nécessaire de convaincre ces pays de prendre des mesures pour résoudre ce problème [(00:14:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=843s).

## Impact des débris sur l'astronomie
- La présence de débris spatiaux gêne les observations astronomiques, car les objets en orbite peuvent perturber les observations et les mesures, et il est nécessaire de prendre des mesures pour réduire l'impact de ces débris [(00:14:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=877s).
- Les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) ont toujours été un problème, mais il n'y a pas eu beaucoup d'intérêt de la part de la communauté astronomique pour résoudre ce problème, même si des présentations et des images ont été réalisées pour sensibiliser à ce sujet il y a plusieurs années [(00:14:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=894s).
- Les gros objets en orbite sont théoriquement prévisibles, mais cela pose des problèmes pour les observations astronomiques, notamment en raison de la constellation [Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink), qui peut créer des zébrures sur les photos prises par les télescopes [(00:15:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=939s).
- Les opérateurs de satellites, tels que [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX), ont créé des actions volontaires pour réduire les perturbations causées par les débris spatiaux, comme le Dark sat et le viseur sat, et ont appliqué une magnitude visuelle supérieure à 7 pour les satellites [(00:16:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=972s).
- Il n'y a pas de réglementation pour les débris spatiaux, mais plutôt des négociations directes entre les opérateurs et les astronomes pour modifier les opérations de mise à poste des satellites [(00:16:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1001s).

## Rentrée atmosphérique des débris
- Les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) finissent par retomber sur Terre en raison de la traînée atmosphérique, qui est la force de freinage qui s'exerce sur les objets en mouvement dans l'atmosphère, et les objets jusqu'à 2000 km d'altitude sont engagés dans des spirales descendantes [(00:17:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1065s).
- En moyenne, 400 à 450 objets catalogués rentrent dans l'atmosphère terrestre chaque année, et il y a également des gros objets intègres qui retombent sur Terre [(00:18:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1089s).
- Les débris spatiaux qui rentrent dans l'atmosphère terrestre subissent un freinage dû à la pression dynamique et peuvent se fragmenter en plusieurs parties, dont certaines peuvent fondre ou s'échauffer à des températures élevées, pouvant atteindre 1000 à 1600 degrés Celsius, [(00:18:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1099s).
- Les matériaux réfractaires tels que le titane, le carbone et certains aciers inox peuvent résister à la chaleur et survivre à la rentrée dans l'atmosphère, comme le montre l'exemple d'un réservoir de pressurisation d'un lanceur Vega en carbone et titane, [(00:19:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1161s).
- Il est estimé que 20 à 30% de la masse des débris spatiaux qui rentrent dans l'atmosphère survivent à la rentrée et peuvent impacter la surface du globe, mais heureusement, 71% de la surface du globe est composée d'océans et de mers, et les zones densément peuplées ne représentent que 3% de la surface, [(00:19:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1190s).
- Malgré le risque d'impact, il n'y a pas eu de victimes recensées à ce jour, mais on estime statistiquement qu'il pourrait y avoir eu deux ou trois victimes au niveau de la validité des modèles, [(00:20:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1219s).
- Il est difficile de prédire avec précision le point d'impact des [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) en raison de la traînée atmosphérique et de la complexité des paramètres impliqués, tels que la température de l'objet et la densité de l'air, [(00:20:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1250s).
- La densité de l'air est très mal connue, notamment à cause de l'activité solaire, qui fait gonfler et dégonfler l'atmosphère, ce qui peut avoir un impact sur les objets en orbite, avec un facteur 4 de méconnaissance sur l'atmosphère haute altitude dans les 100 km d'altitude [(00:21:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1289s).
- La surface présentée par un objet en orbite est également un paramètre mal connu, car elle dépend de la façon dont l'objet vole et de son orientation, ce qui peut avoir un impact sur la trajectoire de l'objet, avec un facteur 3 possible sur un étage de lanceur [(00:22:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1321s).
- La vitesse d'un objet en orbite est bien connue, mais la précision de la trajectoire est limitée, avec une précision de l'ordre de 10% du temps restant en orbite, ce qui signifie que les prévisions de rentrée dans l'atmosphère peuvent être imprécises [(00:22:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1355s).
- Les objets en orbite peuvent survivre à leur rentrée dans l'atmosphère et retomber sur Terre, ce qui peut poser des problèmes de sécurité, notamment si l'objet est gros et peut survivre à la rentrée, comme c'est le cas pour les étages de lanceurs chinois ou les [Falcon 9](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9) [(00:23:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1406s).
- Les retombées d'objets en orbite peuvent être imprévisibles et poser des risques pour les populations, ce qui nécessite une surveillance constante et des prévisions précises pour éviter les accidents [(00:23:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1417s).

## Prédiction et analyse des rentrées atmosphériques
- La fragmentation et le plasma généré par l'échauffement dans l'atmosphère peuvent être analysés pour mieux comprendre les phénomènes de rentrée dans l'atmosphère [(00:24:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1460s).
- Les analyses des [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) sont très intéressantes, comme celle de l'urine des astronautes, mais il est difficile de rentrer trop de temps pour les étudier [(00:24:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1473s).
- Un réservoir de [Falcon 9](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9) est retombé en [Indonésie](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonésie) et a démoli une cahute, et l'ordinateur de bord de Falcon 9 a été récupéré, mais il est endommagé et ne peut plus servir [(00:24:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1494s).

## Collisions en orbite et leurs conséquences
- Les collisions en orbite sont un problème important, car même de petits débris peuvent causer des dommages importants, comme un objet de 1 mm lancé à 15 km par seconde qui peut générer une énergie de 1 kilojoule [(00:26:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1566s).
- Les collisions en orbite peuvent avoir des conséquences graves, comme la perte de 15 % de l'énergie électrique d'un satellite ou la fin de la mission si le débris frappe l'ordinateur de bord [(00:26:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1612s).
- Même de petits débris peuvent causer des dommages importants, comme un objet de 1 cm qui peut générer une énergie de 1 Megajoule, suffisante pour détruire un satellite [(00:26:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1592s).
- Un exemple d'impact de débris sur un panneau solaire a eu lieu en 2016 sur le satellite Sentinelle, où un petit débris a généré une perte de 15 % de l'énergie électrique et une perturbation du satellite [(00:26:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1614s).
- Les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) peuvent avoir des conséquences graves pour les satellites et les missions spatiales, et il est important de les étudier et de les suivre pour prévenir les collisions [(00:25:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1552s).
- Les débris spatiaux peuvent causer des impacts significatifs sur les satellites, comme le montrent les exemples d'impacts sur l'[International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station), [Hubble (télescope spatial)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_(télescope_spatial)), et la navette, avec environ 2,5 impacts significatifs par mission pour la navette [(00:28:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1687s).
- Les simulations ont été réalisées pour évaluer la survivabilité des satellites, comme le satellite SPOT 5, qui a montré que la probabilité de mort du satellite augmente avec la taille des objets, avec une probabilité de mort de 5% pendant la durée de vie opérationnelle du satellite [(00:28:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1717s).
- Une étude menée par les collègues de télés alinés space en [My Last Duchess](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Last_Duchess) a montré une probabilité de perte de mission de 4,5% pour le satellite [Sentinel-1](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel-1), et il est probable que ce chiffre ait augmenté depuis 2013 [(00:29:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1765s).
- L'impact de débris est devenu la première source de mortalité pour les satellites, avec environ 8% de chance de mourir d'un impact de débris aujourd'hui, comme le montre l'exemple du satellite [Iridium 33](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_33) qui a rencontré un vieux débri soviétique et a généré environ 4000 gros débris [(00:29:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1789s).
- L'événement de collision entre Iridium 33 et le débri soviétique a été un événement majeur, mais les conséquences pour les opérateurs de satellites sont minimes car ils ont des satellites de rechange, mais cela souligne l'importance de prendre en compte les risques de collision pour les satellites [(00:30:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1830s).

## Surveillance et prévention des collisions
- Il y a eu un ordre du président des États-Unis pour fournir toutes les informations sur les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) avec tous les détails au monde entier, ce qui a amélioré la situation depuis [(00:31:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1872s).
- Les collisions entre les débris spatiaux peuvent avoir des effets antagonistes, avec d'une part l'arrivée de nouveaux objets en orbite et d'autre part la sortie d'orbite de certains objets grâce à l'atmosphère [(00:32:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1930s).
- Le bilan global des débris spatiaux est préoccupant, avec 14 002 objets nouveaux catalogués en 2020 et seulement 411 objets qui sont sortis de l'atmosphère, ce qui signifie que près de 900 nouveaux objets ont été ajoutés en orbite [(00:32:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1964s).

## Le syndrome de Kessler
- Le syndrome de Kessler, théorisé par Kessler de la [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA), décrit un scénario dans lequel les collisions entre les débris spatiaux deviennent le principal facteur de génération de nouveaux débris en orbite, ce qui pose un problème pour la pérennité de l'orbite [(00:33:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=1996s).
- Les lancements et les explosions en orbite génèrent des débris, mais si les lancements étaient à arrêter, les collisions entre les débris existants seraient le seul phénomène générant de nouveaux débris en orbite [(00:33:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2026s).
- Le nombre d'objets dans l'espace va continuer à augmenter de façon exponentielle, même en absence d'opération spatiale, en raison du syndrome de Kessler, où la régénération de débris par collision mutuelle est supérieure au nettoyage atmosphérique [(00:34:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2047s).
- Le syndrome de Kessler se produit lorsque la régénération de débris par collision est supérieure au nettoyage atmosphérique, et cela se produit actuellement entre 700 et 1100 km d'altitude [(00:34:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2056s).
- Il y a une augmentation naturelle et spontanée du nombre de débris dans la zone située entre 750 et 1100 km d'altitude [(00:34:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2076s).
- Un histogramme présente le nombre d'objets catalogués en fonction de l'altitude, allant de 200 km à 2000 km d'altitude, et montre une augmentation du nombre d'objets entre 2000 et 2021 [(00:34:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2090s).
- La zone située entre 800 km et 1100 km d'altitude montre une augmentation du nombre d'objets, qui peut être expliquée par des collisions faibles et fréquentes, et non par des événements particuliers comme des grosses collisions [(00:35:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2151s).
- Le nombre d'objets dans l'espace a été multiplié par 3,5 entre 2000 et 2021, tandis que le nombre de satellites opérationnels a été divisé par 3 dans la même période [(00:36:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2191s).

## Classification et densité des objets en orbite
- Le projet [Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) est mentionné comme un exemple de nouvelle génération de débris, avec plus de 1500 nouveaux débris attendus [(00:37:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2220s).
- Les objets en orbite peuvent être classés en différentes catégories, notamment les satellites opérationnels, les vieux satellites non opérationnels, les étages de fusée, les fragments issus de collisions et les débris, avec les carrés verts représentant les satellites opérationnels et les carrés jaunes représentant les vieux satellites non opérationnels [(00:37:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2266s).
- La densité des objets en orbite varie en fonction de l'altitude, avec une forte concentration de débris dans certaines zones, notamment entre 900 et 950 km d'altitude, où les objets peuvent rester en orbite pendant environ 500 ans [(00:38:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2310s).
- Les étages russes de type Zénith sont présents dans cette zone, avec 59 objets de 9 mètres de long et 9 tonnes, et certains d'entre eux passent à moins de 100 mètres les uns des autres une fois par mois [(00:38:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2327s).
- Le risque de collision entre les objets en orbite est élevé, et il est important de prendre des mesures pour prévenir les collisions et réduire la quantité de débris en orbite [(00:39:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2342s).

## Réglementation et mesures de réduction des débris
- La première règle fondamentale pour réduire la quantité de débris en orbite est de légiférer et de mettre en place des règles de bon sens, notamment la désorbitation systématique ou la libération des objets en orbite [(00:39:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2372s).
- Cependant, la mise en place de ces règles est complexe et nécessite une volonté collective, et il est donc important d'adopter des mesures à court terme pour réduire la quantité de débris en orbite, notamment en évitant la génération de débris en connaissance de cause [(00:40:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2427s).
- Les quatre pays qui ont réalisé des essais anti-satellites en orbite sont les États-Unis, l'Inde, la Chine et la [Russie](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russie), et cela pose problème car cela génère des [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) [(00:40:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2437s).
- Il est important d'éviter les explosions en orbite et de systématiquement retirer l'énergie interne des étages et des satellites en fin de mission pour prévenir les explosions et les débris [(00:41:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2467s).
- Deux zones protégées dans l'espace sont définies, notamment la zone de basse orbite et la zone de l'orbite géostationnaire, et il est interdit de rester plus de 25 ans après la fin des opérations dans ces zones [(00:41:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2494s).
- Il est nécessaire d'éviter les collisions lorsque cela est possible, en utilisant la propulsion à bord pour éviter les impacts et minimiser le risque de victimes au sol, avec des critères tels qu'une chance sur 10 000 de faire un mort ou un blessé [(00:42:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2570s).
- Les satellites doivent être conçus pour être désorbités après 25 ans, ce qui est au-delà de la durée de vie d'un manager, et cela a été choisi pour éviter que les satellites ne tombent sur les populations [(00:42:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2540s).
- Il est important de prendre en compte la durée de vie des satellites et de leurs composants, tels que les batteries, qui peuvent exploser et générer des débris, et de prendre des mesures pour les prévenir [(00:41:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2480s).
- Les pays doivent travailler ensemble pour mettre en place des règles et des réglementations pour prévenir la génération de [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) et protéger l'environnement spatial [(00:42:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2522s).
- Il existe des principes à suivre pour contrôler la retombe de débris spatiaux, notamment si l'objet pèse plus de 500 kg, et il est préférable de choisir des matériaux qui se désintègrent bien lors de la rentrée dans l'atmosphère, comme l'alu plutôt que le titane [(00:43:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2617s).
- Ces principes ont été déclinés par différentes agences spatiales, notamment la [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) en 1995, les Japonais en 1997, le [Centre national d'études spatiales](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_national_d'études_spatiales) en 1999, et ont abouti à la création de l'[Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Agency_Space_Debris_Coordination_Committee), un club de 13 agences spatiales majeures qui se réunissent deux fois par an pour débattre de ces sujets [(00:44:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2642s).
- L'IADC a établi une proposition de réglementation de manière consensuelle, avec la participation de pays tels que la Chine, l'[Ukraine](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine), la [Russie](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russie), l'Inde, et d'autres, mais comme il s'agit d'une collection d'ingénieurs, ils ne sont pas habilités à écrire des standards ou des lois [(00:44:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2670s).
- La proposition de réglementation a été discutée au niveau européen et a abouti à un code de bonne conduite européen approuvé en 2004, mais il n'a pas de valeur légale et ne constitue que des recommandations [(00:44:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2698s).
- L'ONU a travaillé sur la base des lignes de 2002 et a établi un principe en 2007, mais il s'agit également de guidelines sans valeur légale [(00:45:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2713s).
- Un standard ISO international a été établi en 2010, qui contient des recommandations pour la gestion des [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), mais il ne devient applicable que si les pays le rendent applicable [(00:45:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2731s).
- Chaque pays a sa propre réglementation et vocabulaire pour les débris spatiaux, mais la [France](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) est le seul pays à avoir une loi spécifique sur les opérations spatiales, approuvée en 2008 et révisée en 2017 [(00:46:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2785s).
- Il existe une réglementation très bien partagée au niveau mondial pour vérifier la conformité à la loi, avec des amendes significatives pour les non-conformités, et les lancements de satellites sont soumis à des règles strictes [(00:46:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2802s).

## Protection des satellites et recyclage
- Pour se protéger des débris spatiaux, il est possible de blinder les surfaces avec des structures comme le [Kevlar](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevlar), qui peut arrêter les débris de petite taille, mais cette solution est limitée à un centimètre environ [(00:47:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2827s).
- Les satellites peuvent être protégés avec des blindages, mais cela est compliqué, lourd, complexe et cher, et a un impact important sur la conception des satellites [(00:47:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2872s).
- Les modules habités, comme ceux de l'[International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station), sont bien protégés avec plusieurs couches de blindage, mais cette protection est efficace seulement jusqu'à 1 cm [(00:48:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2914s).
- Il est difficile de protéger les satellites des débris de taille comprise entre 1 et 10 cm, car ils sont trop énergétiques pour être protégés et trop petits pour être vus [(00:48:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2935s).
- Le recyclage des satellites est une option limitée, car il est possible de cannibaliser les pièces d'un satellite mort pour les utiliser sur un autre, mais cela est très théorique et peu pratique [(00:49:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2960s).
- Le recyclage en orbite nécessite une grande quantité de débris, mais malheureusement, il n'y en a pas assez, donc l'évitation des collisions est une alternative, ce qui peut être fait en prévoyant les trajectoires des satellites et des débris [(00:49:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2985s).

## Prévision et évitement des collisions
- Les objets catalogués peuvent être suivis pour savoir où ils seront demain, et ainsi prévoir les risques de collision, ce qui est fait en utilisant des calculs de propagation de matrice de covariance pour déterminer les probabilités de collision [(00:49:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=2996s).
- Si la probabilité de collision dépasse un certain seuil, une manœuvre peut être effectuée pour éviter la collision, ce qui est fait en moyenne une fois par an par satellite dans le monde [(00:50:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3026s).
- Le système de surveillance de l'espace, appelé SST, utilise des réseaux de télescopes et de radars pour suivre les orbites des satellites et des débris, et il y a de nombreux acteurs institutionnels et privés impliqués dans cette activité, tels que le réseau Space Airwin Network des Américains et les radars de Léo Labs [(00:51:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3062s).
- Même si une collision est inévitable, il est possible de dévier légèrement la trajectoire de l'un des objets en question, ce qui peut être fait en introduisant une marge de 1 km en déviant de 3,6 mm par seconde 24 heures avant la collision [(00:52:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3137s).
- Les startups privées, comme Léo Labs, jouent un rôle important dans la surveillance de l'espace et la traçabilité des satellites, et ont fait des progrès significatifs dans ce domaine [(00:51:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3091s).
- Les équipes de surveillance de l'espace, comme celles du centre de [Toulouse](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse), travaillent 24 heures sur 24 et 7 jours sur 7 pour protéger les satellites et prévenir les collisions [(00:50:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3049s).
- Les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) tournent à une vitesse de 8 km par seconde, ce qui signifie que même une petite poussée peut avoir un impact important, comme un souffle qui peut dévier leur trajectoire [(00:52:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3169s).

## Solutions pour l'élimination des débris
- Il existe des solutions pour éliminer les débris spatiaux, comme utiliser un propulseur pour propulser un gaz devant le débris et le ralentir, ou utiliser un laser pour le détruire, et il y a de nombreuses études sur le sujet [(00:53:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3184s).
- Pour stabiliser la situation, il est important de respecter la réglementation et de retirer environ 10 gros débris par an, qui sont les plus dangereux et les plus susceptibles de générer de nouveaux débris [(00:53:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3219s).
- La [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) a réalisé des études qui montrent que si on ne fait rien, la quantité de débris spatiaux augmentera de manière exponentielle, mais que si on retire quelques débris, on peut améliorer la situation [(00:53:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3228s).
- Il y a des startups et des organisations qui travaillent sur le sujet, comme Clearspace, qui est une émanation de l'[École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/École_polytechnique_fédérale_de_Lausanne) à [Lausanne](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne), et qui prévoit de lancer une mission pour retirer un débris en 2026 [(00:55:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3301s).

## Gestion du trafic spatial et défis futurs
- Il est important de mettre en place des règles et des priorités pour la gestion du trafic spatial, ce qui est un sujet de travail important au niveau international, avec des groupes de travail qui réunissent des membres de différents pays [(00:55:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3326s).
- Les règles de l'établissement des informations pour les satellites ne sont pas évidentes, notamment pour les satellites militaires ou chinois, et il est difficile de remédier aux [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) à long terme [(00:55:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3345s).
- Il y a des inquiétudes sérieuses concernant le respect de la réglementation internationale, notamment en orbite basse, où seulement 64% des missions respectent les règles, et ce pourcentage diminue encore pour les satellites qui se trouvent au-dessus de 600 km d'altitude [(00:56:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3391s).
- Les gros satellites, de plus de 100 kg, ne respectent les règles que dans 6% des cas, et personne ne prend de mesures volontaires pour arrêter une mission pour respecter la réglementation [(00:57:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3423s).
- Il y a un grand nombre de débris spatiaux, avec une fragmentation par mois en moyenne, et les cubsat, qui sont de très petits satellites, sont difficiles à traquer et ont une fiabilité très faible [(00:57:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3461s).
- Les mégas constellations satellites, comme [Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) et oneweb, lancent des milliers de nouveaux satellites, ce qui pose des problèmes de respect de la réglementation et de gestion des débris spatiaux [(00:58:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3499s).
- Les lancements de satellites, tels que ceux de Starlink et oneweb, prévoient des milliers de nouveaux satellites, avec des nombres qui peuvent aller jusqu'à 40 000 ou 120 000, ce qui soulève des inquiétudes concernant la gestion des débris spatiaux [(00:58:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3514s).
- Il y a une concurrence accrue dans le domaine spatial, avec les Chinois et [Jeff Bezos](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos) qui ont annoncé des constellations de satellites, et on s'attend à avoir 100000 nouveaux satellites d'ici 2030, ce qui pose des problématiques [(00:58:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3522s).
- Actuellement, il y a environ 4000 satellites en orbite, alors qu'il y en avait 1500 il y a 15 ans, et même si les nouvelles lois réglementent les lancements, elles ne peuvent pas avoir d'effet rétroactif sur les satellites déjà lancés [(00:58:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3535s).
- La seule solution pour résoudre les problèmes posés par les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) est de discuter avec les entreprises et les gouvernements pour les convaincre de prendre des mesures pour réduire les débris et améliorer la fiabilité [(00:59:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3561s).
- Une prise de conscience générale et rapide suivie d'actions concrètes est nécessaire pour résoudre les problèmes posés par les débris spatiaux et assurer un avenir sûr pour l'exploration spatiale [(00:59:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3567s).
- Il est possible de prendre des mesures pour améliorer la situation, mais cela nécessite une collaboration internationale et une volonté de changer les pratiques actuelles, comme le montre l'exemple de M. [Elon Musk](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) et de son entreprise [(00:59:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdDcon4zRYo&t=3552s).

# Le CNES, leader mondial dans la réduction des débris spatiaux
![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J7yRdT3Rv1c/maxresdefault.jpg)



## La problématique des débris spatiaux
- La [Problématique](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problématique) des [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) est un problème complexe qui concerne la pollution de débris autour de la Terre, créée par les opérateurs et ayant un impact sur l'ensemble des opérateurs, avec des [Conséquences](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conséquences) dramatiques possibles en cas de collision [(00:00:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yRdT3Rv1c&t=10s).
- Un débris spatial est défini comme un petit objet qui se déplace très vite, à 8 km par seconde, et qui peut avoir des conséquences dramatiques en cas de collision, même avec une petite masse [(00:00:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yRdT3Rv1c&t=22s).
- Les débris spatiaux sont classés en deux catégories : les gros débris détectables et les petits débris indétectables, ce qui rend difficile la protection contre ces derniers [(00:00:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yRdT3Rv1c&t=58s).
- Le [Centre national d'études spatiales](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_national_d'études_spatiales) travaille depuis plusieurs années sur l'espace durable et la viabilité à long terme des activités spaciales, avec des premiers standards et règles de non prolifération des débris établis dans les années 90 [(00:01:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yRdT3Rv1c&t=75s).

## Supervision de l'espace et des débris
- Pour superviser l'espace et les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), plusieurs systèmes sont mis en place, notamment le réseau de senseurs Tarot, d'autres réseaux commerciaux ou européens, et le système Kesar d'anticollision en orbite [(00:01:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yRdT3Rv1c&t=109s).
- Le CNES s'efforce d'avoir le meilleur réseau de capteurs et le meilleur catalogue orbital possible pour rendre un service d'anticollision efficace, en travaillant sur différents algorithmes et méthodes, tels que le filtrage des objets et les calculs de probabilités de collision [(00:02:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yRdT3Rv1c&t=128s).

## Législation et réglementation
- La loi relative aux opérations spatiales a été mise en place en 2008, avec une réglementation technique visant à réduire la prolifération des débris spatiaux, et une grande partie de ces exigences ont pour objectif de préserver la sécurité et la durabilité de l'espace [(00:02:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yRdT3Rv1c&t=152s).
- Le problème des débris spatiaux ne peut être résolu que par une collaboration internationale, c'est pourquoi la [France](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) se réunit chaque année au sein de l'[Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Agency_Space_Debris_Coordination_Committee) pour partager les travaux et les efforts pour résoudre ce problème, malheureusement, de nombreux pays n'ont pas encore accès à une loi claire et un cadre clair pour définir des exigences à respecter [(00:02:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yRdT3Rv1c&t=168s).

## Sécurité, sûreté et durabilité des opérations spatiales
- Les efforts pour assurer la sécurité, la sûreté et la durabilité des opérations spatiales sont nécessaires, notamment avec le contexte économique actuel et l'intérêt nouveau des entreprises privées pour le spatial, et l'institution a pour devoir de maintenir le service national et de rester agile et pertinente [(00:03:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yRdT3Rv1c&t=193s).
- La loi a inscrit des exigences techniques pour les opérateurs français, qui fabriquent aujourd'hui des satellites et des lanceurs avec une empreinte zéro débris, et l'objectif est de donner accès à ces technologies pour que tout le monde puisse faire des satellites respectueux de l'environnement spatial [(00:03:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yRdT3Rv1c&t=223s).

## Innovation et solutions technologiques
- Un système comme le DTEMbler permet de stabiliser un satellite en panne et de le rendre plus facile à dépanner ou à remorquer, et cela peut inspirer d'autres acteurs à créer un cadre pertinent pour l'exploitation de l'espace [(00:04:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yRdT3Rv1c&t=261s).
- Résoudre le problème des [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) nécessite d'abord d'éduquer les opérateurs pour avoir des opérations responsables et avec des véhicules qui ont une empreinte zéro débris, et cela aura un impact positif pour l'avenir de l'espace [(00:05:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yRdT3Rv1c&t=302s).

## Conclusion : Le rôle du CNES
- Le [Centre national d'études spatiales](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_national_d'études_spatiales) est un leader mondial dans la réduction des débris spatiaux, mais il n'y a pas d'informations spécifiques fournies dans le texte fourni [(00:05:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7yRdT3Rv1c&t=319s)

# Is Space Becoming A Dustbin?
![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cy_4Ow88pdY/maxresdefault.jpg)



## Introduction des débris spatiaux
- Il existe des millions d'objets artificiels qui tournent en orbite au-dessus de la Terre, parmi lesquels on trouve des satellites actifs très utiles, mais aussi d'innombrables débris qui ne servent à rien et forment une sorte de gigantesque [Constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation) qui transforme l'espace proche en décharge à ciel ouvert [(00:00:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=10s).
- Le premier satellite artificiel, Sputnik 1, a été mis en orbite autour de la Terre le 4 octobre 1957, et il a transmis les premières données scientifiques directement depuis l'espace [(00:00:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=48s).
- Moins d'un mois plus tard, les Soviétiques ont envoyé un deuxième satellite dans l'espace, Sputnik 2, qui a emporté le premier être vivant en orbite, la chienne [Laïka](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laïka) [(00:01:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=71s).
- La course à l'espace a été lancée, et en juin 1963, on dénombrait déjà plus d'une centaine de satellites en orbite autour de la Terre [(00:01:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=90s).

## L'encombrement croissant de l'espace
- Aujourd'hui, on estime qu'environ 28 000 objets, dont 9 000 satellites actifs, gravitent au-dessus de nos têtes, la plupart à une altitude comprise entre 200 et 2 000 km, dans ce qu'on appelle l'orbite basse [(00:02:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=126s).
- Les satellites artificiels jouent un rôle important sur les plans militaires, économiques et scientifiques, et sans eux, les prévisions météorologiques seraient beaucoup moins précises et certaines données sur la déforestation et l'état des océans feraient cruellement défaut aux experts [(00:02:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=177s).

## Problématique des débris spatiaux
- L'espace est de plus en plus encombré par les satellites fonctionnels et non fonctionnels, ainsi que par les débris de satellite, ce qui pose problème pour la navigation et les télécommunications [(00:03:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=192s).
- Les débris spatiaux sont très nombreux, avec environ 150 millions de débris de petite taille (entre 1 mm et 10 cm) et 20 000 débris de plus de 10 cm, qui peuvent provenir de pièces détachées de satellites ou d'étages supérieurs de lanceurs spatiaux [(00:03:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=226s).
- Les débris spatiaux peuvent gêner l'observation du ciel en traversant le champ de vision des télescopes ou en réfléchissant la lumière, ce qui fausse les données et complique le travail des scientifiques [(00:04:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=272s).
- Les débris en orbite basse représentent une grande menace pour les satellites actifs et les véhicules habités comme l'[International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station), en raison de leur vitesse élevée, qui peut atteindre plus de 25 000 km/h [(00:04:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=294s).
- Une collision entre deux objets en orbite peut créer un nombre incalculable de nouveaux débris, ce qui augmente le risque de collision avec d'autres objets, phénomène connu sous le nom de syndrome de Kessler [(00:05:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=345s).
- Un exemple de collision spectaculaire est l'impact entre un satellite américain et une épave de satellite militaire russe en 2009, qui a projeté des milliers de débris dans l'espace [(00:05:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=329s).

## Retombée des débris spatiaux
- Les objets en orbite autour de la Terre finissent toujours par retomber à cause des frottements, même à plusieurs centaines de kilomètres d'altitude, car l'espace n'est pas complètement vide et il reste des traces d'air qui exercent des frottements sur les satellites et les ralentissent [(00:06:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=376s).
- Les chances pour qu'un humain soit percuté au sol par un objet spatial sont très faibles, car la plupart des débris brûlent en entrant dans l'atmosphère, et on estime que 20 % seulement parviennent jusqu'au sol [(00:07:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=421s).
- Une seule personne a été percutée par un débris spatial, une Américaine nommée Lotty Williams, qui a été touchée par un fragment provenant d'une fusée Delta 2 en 1997 [(00:07:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=433s).

## Solutions et préoccupations concernant la pollution spatiale
- La question de la pollution spatiale préoccupe les scientifiques depuis toujours, et un comité dédié, l'[Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Agency_Space_Debris_Coordination_Committee), a été créé en 1983 pour améliorer les pratiques et réduire les débris spatiaux [(00:07:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=477s).
- Les scientifiques travaillent pour trouver des solutions pour limiter le nombre et l'impact des débris spatiaux, et l'une des solutions envisagées est de rapatrier les plus gros débris sur Terre en les séparant en plusieurs morceaux et en les désorbitant progressivement [(00:08:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=524s).
- Un "cimetière" a été créé au beau milieu de l'océan Pacifique, qui est l'endroit le plus éloigné d'une terre émergée, pour faire retomber des structures de grande taille sans risque de blesser quiconque et en minimisant l'impact environnemental [(00:08:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=538s).
- La fin de service pour certains objets spatiaux est prévue pour 2031 et devrait rejoindre le point néo d'ici 7 ans, ce qui soulève des questions sur la manière de s'en débarrasser [(00:09:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=567s).
- Les millions de petits débris qui traînent dans l'espace sont un problème important, et il est mission impossible de s'en débarrasser à court terme, mais une partie finira peu à peu par se désorbiter et se désintégrer dans l'atmosphère [(00:09:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=575s).

## Mesures de protection contre les débris spatiaux
- Pour limiter l'impact des collisions, certains engins sont équipés de boucliers de protection conçus pour protéger les vaisseaux habités et les satellites des débris spatiaux et des météorites [(00:09:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=589s).
- L'[International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) est équipé de ces boucliers de protection, mais cela ne suffit pas, et les agences spatiales suivent donc en temps réel les objets en orbite dont la taille dépasse 10 cm [(00:09:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=599s).
- En cas de danger, les satellites peuvent exécuter une manœuvre d'évitement, et l'ISS a réalisé 38 de ces manœuvres depuis sa mise en service [(00:10:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy_4Ow88pdY&t=611s).

## SATGUS: The Space Selfie Satellite  
- The custom-made artificial satellite, named **SATGUS**, will be hurtling through space at **8 kilometers per second** in about a month. What makes **SATGUS** special is that it carries a **smartphone** and a **camera**—its sole purpose is to take your **selfie in space**, with the entire **Earth** as your backdrop. [(00:00:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=3s)  
To build a machine and send it into space, six steps are required.  
- **Step 1:** Design your satellite using **CAD** (Computer-Aided Design) before proceeding with other processes. [(00:00:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=53s)  
- SATGUS adopts a CubeSat design. About 25 years ago, two professors at Stanford University discovered that most artificial satellites require some of the same basic components, such as solar panels, radio communication devices, and computers. [(00:01:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=83s)  
- The structure of SATGUS includes hardware necessary for maintaining the satellite's basic functions, such as computers, all located in one area, while the remaining space is reserved for the payload. This is the functional zone of the artificial satellite, where you can put whatever you want. [(00:01:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=116s)  

## Steps to Build and Launch a Satellite  
- To build a machine and send it into space, six steps are required. The first step is to design your satellite using CAD, which stands for Computer-Aided Design, before proceeding with other processes. [(00:00:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=53s)

This is the functional zone of the artificial satellite, where you can put whatever you want. [(00:01:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=116s)  

## Components of SATGUS  
- Let’s take a look at the specific components on SATGUS. Many of these hardware components might be useful for you. First, let’s talk about its unique feature—the payload. This part will be used to take photos. Once the satellite enters space and operates normally, these two spring-loaded panels will open. [(00:02:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=143s)  
- Regarding power, we installed solar panels. The energy will be stored in several 120-watt-hour batteries. The satellite orbits the Earth every 90 minutes. If the solar panels remain facing the sun, the energy provided every 90 minutes can charge a smartphone nine times. [(00:03:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=184s)  
- To address the satellite’s rotation, a rotating wheel called a reaction wheel is used. Angular momentum is always conserved. If the reaction wheel spins in one direction, according to the laws of physics, the satellite must spin in the opposite direction to maintain balance. [(00:03:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=217s)  
- By wrapping a $2 crystalline iron rod with wires and electrifying them, a magnetic field can be created to alter the direction of a compass. However, this magnetic field must align with Earth’s magnetic field. [(00:04:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=276s)  
- To help the satellite determine its position relative to Earth, GPS, an inertial measurement unit, and two star trackers are installed. The latter will take photos of the stars and compare them with stored images to determine the satellite’s orientation. [(00:05:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=303s)  
- Since strong sunlight might prevent the star trackers from capturing the stars, two sun sensors are also installed. They assume the brightest point is the sun to achieve precise positioning. [(00:05:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=328s)  
- To communicate with the satellite, two radio devices are installed—one slow and one fast. The ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio has slow data transmission speeds and is used for basic commands and telemetry. The S-band radio has extremely fast transmission speeds and is used for photo transfers. [(00:05:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=339s)  
- The onboard computer is the brain of the satellite. It receives signals from sensors and radios and decides when the satellite should turn or take photos. [(00:05:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=356s)

## Satellite Attitude Control System  
- To address the satellite’s rotation, a rotating wheel called a reaction wheel is used. Angular momentum is always conserved. If the reaction wheel spins in one direction, according to the laws of physics, the satellite must spin in the opposite direction to maintain balance.

## Onboard Computer  
- The onboard computer is the brain of the satellite. It receives signals from sensors and radios and decides when the satellite should turn or take photos. [(00:05:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=356s)  

## Deadly Threats in Space  
- There are four factors in space that can kill a satellite: intense vibrations, alternating extreme temperatures, space radiation, and asteroid impacts. Careful analysis and proper protective measures are required. [(00:06:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=370s)  
- To ensure the satellite’s hardware can withstand rocket vibrations, a finite element model is used to break down the entire model into smaller grids. The resonant frequency of each component is calculated to ensure they are all higher than the rocket’s vibration frequency. [(00:08:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=490s)  
- Extreme temperatures in space pose a threat to the satellite. Under sunlight, the satellite’s temperature can reach 100 degrees Celsius, while in shadow, it can drop to -80 degrees Celsius. [(00:08:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=534s)  
- The satellite will face extreme temperature changes in space, switching from twice the highest desert temperature to the lowest recorded temperature in Antarctica every 90 minutes. Such fluctuations can quickly freeze or overheat electronic equipment. [(00:09:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=559s)  
- To prevent electronic equipment from freezing in shadow, heaters are installed on the satellite, along with surface coatings to dissipate heat and avoid overheating in sunlight. [(00:09:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=574s)  
- The third deadly threat in space is solar radiation. One hour of direct sunlight in space is equivalent to a full year of sunlight exposure on Earth. [(00:09:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=591s)  
- To protect the satellite from radiation, critical electronic components are shielded with sufficiently thick metal or glass plates to prevent damage from solar and other sources of radiation. [(00:10:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=603s)  
- By simulating the harsh space environment in a radiation chamber, the radiation resistance of the Google Pixel phone was tested. It was found that 6 mm thick aluminum plates and 5 mm thick radiation-resistant glass are needed to ensure the satellite’s safety. [(00:10:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=623s)  
- This project received strong support from Google Pixel and T-Mobile. The Google Pixel phone will be used for space selfies, and T-Mobile will provide satellite signal services. [(00:10:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=652s)  
- The fourth deadly threat in space is vacuum. Rubber, foam, and lithium batteries on the satellite can expand or release gas in a vacuum, damaging other equipment. [(00:11:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=677s)  
- To prevent damage to the satellite in a vacuum, necessary protective measures must be taken, such as using pressure suits or reinforcing the satellite’s structure. [(00:11:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=691s)  
- Currently, the number of artificial satellites and other objects orbiting Earth is large, but due to the small size of satellites, the probability of collision is almost zero. [(00:12:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=729s)  
- SATGUS does not need thrusters to avoid other satellites because the probability of collision is extremely low. [(00:12:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=745s)  

## Vibration Countermeasures  
- To ensure the satellite’s hardware can withstand rocket vibrations, a finite element model is used to break down the entire model into smaller grids. The resonant frequency of each component is calculated to ensure they are all higher than the rocket’s vibration frequency. [(00:08:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=490s)

## Collision Avoidance Strategy  
- Currently, the number of artificial satellites and other objects orbiting Earth is large, but due to the small size of satellites, the probability of collision is almost zero. [(00:12:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=729s)  
- SATGUS does not need thrusters to avoid other satellites because the probability of collision is extremely low. [(00:12:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=745s)  

## Satellite Lifespan and Decommissioning  
- Any satellite entering orbit must burn up or disintegrate within a specified timeframe. SATGUS will remain active in orbit for only one to three years. [(00:12:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=774s)

## Launch Preparation and Deployment  
- After testing, the satellite is loaded into a launch dispenser for transport. Once in orbit, the dispenser remains on the rocket, and a spring mechanism gently pushes the satellite into space. [(00:17:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=1075s)  

## Launch Process  
- SATGUS will launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The launch involves multiple stages, including rocket separation and satellite deployment. [(00:18:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=1106s)  
- SpaceX was chosen as the launch provider because their prices are much lower than other companies, and booking a rocket launch on their website is very convenient. [(00:18:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=1116s)  
- To cover all locations on Earth, the satellite must follow a specific orbit—the same one used by spy satellites to monitor any point on the planet. [(00:19:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=1149s)  
- Vandenberg Space Force Base is the ideal launch site in the U.S. because the area south of the launch site must be water for safety reasons. [(00:19:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=1158s)  
- The Falcon 9’s payload fairing is large enough to fit a school bus and can carry 50 to 100 satellites, including SATGUS. [(00:19:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=1196s)

# How to clean up our space waste
![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JM1jDq-8Cxk/maxresdefault.jpg)



## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=0s)
- Space is used daily, with thousands of satellites supporting modern life, including TV signals, phone calls, [Google Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps), [Global Positioning System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System), the internet, bank transactions, and more, to keep lives running smoothly [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=0s)
- These satellites facilitate various essential services, such as disaster planning, military surveillance, air traffic control, weather prediction, crop farming, and providing data on the oceans, outer space, and global warming [(00:00:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=8s)
- The increasing number of satellites in space has led to a significant amount of space junk, posing an explosive threat, as the focus was on setting up satellites without considering future sustainability [(00:00:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=12s)
- The problem of space junk has become a major concern, with the need to determine the amount of junk in orbit and find a way to clean it up [(00:00:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=38s)
- The satellites provide crucial services, including Google Maps, GPS, and the internet, and also support the stock market, disaster planning, and military surveillance, highlighting the importance of addressing the space junk issue [(00:00:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=21s)

## Why space junk is dangerous [(00:00:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=54s)
- The [Space environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment) is not as empty as it is often perceived, with lower [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) orbit being more crowded than ever, having broken records for space launches in 2022 with over 2,000 spacecraft going into orbit [(00:00:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=54s).
- In addition to functioning spacecraft, there are thousands of dead and broken satellites, old rocket parts, and other man-made [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) flying around Earth at high speeds, posing a significant threat of collisions [(00:00:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=58s).
- The threat of collisions is a major problem due to the high speeds of orbiting objects, which can reach up to 28,000 kilometers per hour, and even a small screw colliding with a spacecraft can have a devastating impact [(00:01:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=79s).
- Space debris can collide, explode, and break into thousands of tiny pieces, making it difficult to remove once it becomes small [(00:01:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=86s).
- The issue of space debris has been accumulating since the 1950s, with no plan or system in place for cleaning up satellites and other objects launched into space [(00:01:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=102s).
- With over 90 countries operating in space and an estimated 17,000 new satellites set to be launched by 2030, the problem of space debris is expected to worsen, potentially creating a "super junk space highway" and making some areas of Earth's orbit unusable for future generations [(00:01:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=117s).
- The pollution of space with waste is a significant environmental concern, similar to the pollution of other environments, such as the ocean, and it is essential to address this issue to prevent long-term damage [(00:02:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=129s).

## Ingenious solutions [(00:02:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=155s)
- Big tech players are working to make the space race more sustainable, with former [Apple Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) co-founder [Steve Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak) heading a company called [Privateer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privateer) that tracks over 27,000 larger pieces of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) in real time to prevent explosive collisions [(00:02:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=157s).
- Privateer's competition, [LeoLabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeoLabs), provides a similar debris tracking service and sends out more than 400 million collision alerts to satellites every month, but tracking smaller pieces of space junk is not possible and maneuvering satellites to avoid collisions is costly [(00:02:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=173s).
- The cost of avoiding collisions is not only financial, as it also results in a loss of scientific data, with space debris analyst Jan Siminski noting that switching off an instrument on board to perform an avoidance maneuver means a huge amount of data is lost [(00:03:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=199s).
- Reducing the number of satellite launches is not a quick fix, as every collision in lower [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) orbit generates a new cloud of debris, causing more collisions and potentially leading to the Kessler syndrome, a cascading ricochet effect [(00:03:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=220s).
- Imogen Nappa and her team at [University of Portsmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Portsmouth) are advocating for an orbital trustee, where nations and industries using Earth's orbit would work together to decide how to use the area sustainably, drawing comparisons between space debris and plastic trash in the ocean [(00:03:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=238s).
- The establishment of an orbital trustee is seen as a necessary step to prevent further damage to Earth's orbit, with the success of the High Seas treaty taking 20 years to come to an agreement, and now requiring quick action to address the issue of space debris [(00:04:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=262s).

## How to de-orbit [(00:04:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=275s)
- De-orbiting a piece of space waste involves grabbing it and pushing it down into Earth's atmosphere where it mostly burns up upon re-entry, a process that is not cheap, with a spacecraft removal mission costing around 100 million euros [(00:04:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=276s).
- The European Space Agency's first actual removal mission will be launched in 2025 by a [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) startup called Clear Space, which has developed a solution that uses a big grappling system to pick up a large piece of debris from orbit [(00:04:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=299s).
- Clear Space's solution involves rendezvousing with the subject at 28,000 kilometers per hour, allowing their speed to match the subject, and then capturing it in an environment with no friction and no gravity [(00:05:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=326s).
- Once the object is captured, it will be stabilized and slowed down to reintroduce it into the Earth's atmosphere in the South Pacific over Point Nemo, where the object will burn out [(00:05:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=341s).
- Professor Giuliamo Alietti from the Surrey Space Center is working on a lower-cost space junk removal concept, which includes a cleanup satellite with a spider-like net to entangle a piece of floating metal [(00:06:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=360s).
- Japan-based startup [Astroscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroscale) is hoping to cut costs by considering the cleanup process from the beginning, and has developed a magnetic arm that can attach to a metal plate on a satellite, making it easier to remove [(00:06:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=385s).
- Astroscale's goal is to see a circular economy in orbit, where satellites are maintained, repaired, and removed after launch, rather than being left to become debris [(00:07:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=421s).
- Astroscale's team, led by Chris Blackaby, believes that all satellites should have some kind of capability to be more easily docked with, to help reduce future debris [(00:06:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=414s).

## Challenges [(00:07:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=436s)
- There is a five-year rule for satellites to be de-orbited after completing their missions, but space guidelines are hard to enforce and there is no authority to ensure compliance [(00:07:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=436s).
- The development of cleanup technologies by one country can be perceived as a potential weapon by another, and examples include broom lasers being developed in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China), and [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) to nudge space junk pieces off a collision course [(00:07:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=451s).
- [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) has been suspected of building a giant laser to blind and damage other satellites from the ground, highlighting the need for regulation to prevent such technologies from being used offensively [(00:07:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=467s).
- Destroying unwanted or defunct satellites with ground missiles has been an environmental disaster for lower [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) orbit, with demonstrations made by the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), China, [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), and Russia, generating massive fields of debris [(00:08:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=495s).
- The impact of these weapons on the [Space environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment) is worse than the loss of the satellite itself, and the latest test made by Russia will affect the operations of the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) (ISS) for years [(00:08:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=510s).
- The number of satellites in orbit is set to increase fourfold by 2030, which will rapidly increase the risk posed by space junk, but the technology for removal missions is almost ready, and what is needed is political commitment to fund these missions [(00:08:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=531s).

## Conclusion [(00:09:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=553s)
- To maintain the connected world as it is currently known, governments, businesses, and scientists will need to seriously rethink how they treat the space environment [(00:09:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=555s)
- The issue of space junk and who should be responsible for cleaning it up needs to be considered in order to find the best way to address the problem [(00:09:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=566s)

# How to Build a Satellite
![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5voQfQOTem8/maxresdefault.jpg)



## Introduction
- Satellites are essential tools in the modern world, facilitating global communication, gathering scientific data, and exploring the cosmos and other planets in the solar system [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=0s).
- A satellite can be thought of as two separate systems: the payload and the bus, with the payload being the equipment used to carry out the mission and the bus being everything else [(00:00:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=37s).
- The payload varies depending on the mission, such as cameras and radar equipment for an [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) observation mission, transponders and high-gain antennas for a communications mission, and probes and sensors for a scientific research mission [(00:00:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=43s).
- Satellites come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, from micro satellites weighing under 100 kg to large satellites weighing over 1,000 kg, and pico satellites weighing less than 1 kg [(00:01:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=76s).

## The CubeSat
- The nano satellite category includes the [CubeSat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat), a standardized cube-shaped unit called 1U, which is designed to be modular and low-cost, and can scale up to 3U, 6U, and 12U sizes [(00:01:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=97s).

## Satellite Subsystems
- Regardless of size, the bus of a satellite usually has seven fundamental subsystems: mechanical structure, onboard computer, [Electric power system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_system), attitude determination and control system, propulsion system, communication system, and [Spacecraft thermal control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_thermal_control) [(00:02:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=135s).

## Mechanical Structure
- The mechanical structure needs to be strong and stiff to survive launch, but also as light as possible to save on launch costs, and engineers use smart design, thorough analysis, and careful material selection to achieve this [(00:02:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=155s).
- Materials used in satellites need to have good stiffness and strength properties relative to their weight, and must be checked for outgassing, where the vacuum of space causes materials to release gases trapped within them [(00:02:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=173s).
- A process called bakeout can be used to reduce the risk of outgassing, where the flight hardware is heated under vacuum conditions to accelerate outgassing before integration into the satellite [(00:03:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=226s).
- The satellite structure includes a separation system that attaches to the launch vehicle adapter, and deployable mechanisms are often used for solar panels, instrument booms, and antennas to get around the limited volume allocated to the satellite in the fairing of the launch vehicle [(00:04:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=244s).

## Onboard Computer
- At the core of every satellite is the onboard computer, which controls and coordinates all the satellite's functions, including the payload [(00:04:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=272s).
- A satellite's onboard computer manages the [Electric power system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_system), which generates, stores, and distributes power to operate the satellite, and is typically built around several printed circuit boards housed in an aluminum alloy enclosure [(00:04:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=287s).
- One major challenge with putting electronics in space is their exposure to cosmic radiation, which can penetrate the satellite's structure, disrupt circuits, and lead to system failure, particularly affecting the onboard computer [(00:04:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=297s).
- To mitigate this, engineers often use radiation-hardened components and shield sensitive parts or the whole device with layers of thick aluminum [(00:05:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=331s).

## Electrical Power System
- The onboard computer manages the electrical power system, which generates power through solar arrays, the most common method of generating power for satellites [(00:06:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=360s).
- A 1 square meter area directly facing the sun just above Earth's atmosphere will receive 1.3 kW of solar power, making solar arrays an efficient method of generating power [(00:05:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=354s).
- Satellites use multi-junction solar cells constructed from multiple layers of different semiconductor materials, which capture a wider range of wavelengths than single-junction cells, making them more efficient [(00:06:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=391s).
- Satellites experience periods of eclipse when in Earth's shadow, where solar arrays are unable to generate power, and need to carry batteries charged by solar panels during periods of exposure to sunlight [(00:06:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=407s).
- The [Electric power system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_system) is controlled by the satellite's power control unit, which interfaces with the onboard computer, monitors the charge level of the batteries, controls charging and discharging, and regulates voltage to ensure a stable power supply [(00:07:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=425s).

## Attitude Determination and Control System
- The attitude determination and control system determines and adjusts the satellite's orientation relative to a reference frame, which is crucial for normal operation, including pointing the payload, solar panels, and antenna [(00:07:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=447s).
- The attitude determination and control system uses sensors to determine the current satellite attitude and actuators to make necessary adjustments, with the strategy selected based on the pointing requirements of the mission and the size of the satellite [(00:08:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=502s).
- Satellites often carry an inertial measurement unit that contains gyroscopes and accelerometers, which provide a continuous measure of any changes in satellite orientation, but require additional sensors to obtain good pointing knowledge [(00:08:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=531s).
- Attitude determination combines gyroscope measurements with data from star trackers, which provide highly accurate reference measurements of the satellite attitude to periodically correct the continuous attitude measurement provided by the gyroscopes [(00:09:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=559s).
- Star trackers are cameras that capture an image of the sky, use an algorithm to identify bright stars, and compare their position in the image with a catalog of known stars to determine the satellite's orientation [(00:09:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=585s).
- Star trackers can be very accurate but may not work well if pointed close to the Sun or if the satellite is spinning too fast relative to the camera shutter speed, and options for accommodating them on the satellite are limited [(00:10:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=602s).
- Engineers designing the system need to take into account the limitations of star trackers and select attitude sensors based on the mission requirements, with alternatives including sun sensors or magnetometers [(00:10:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=627s).
- Sun sensors are simple devices that use photo detector cells to estimate the attitude of the satellite relative to the Sun, but they don't work during the eclipse portion of an orbit [(00:10:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=638s).
- Magnetometers measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field surrounding the satellite, comparing the measurements with a model of the expected magnetic field of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) to estimate its attitude [(00:10:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=653s).
- Most modern satellites use three-axis stabilization for attitude control, where actuators are used to precisely control satellite orientation around three axes [(00:11:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=678s).
- Reaction wheels are a common actuator, consisting of a flywheel attached to an electric motor, which causes the satellite to rotate about its center of mass in the opposite direction when the motor changes the rotational velocity of the reaction wheel [(00:11:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=692s).
- A minimum of three reaction wheels mounted in orthogonal planes give the satellite full three-axis control, allowing minute adjustments to be made to the satellite attitude [(00:11:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=708s).
- Reaction wheels can become saturated after a certain number of attitude adjustments, requiring alternative methods for attitude control, such as magnetorquers [(00:12:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=720s).
- Magnetorquers are coils of conductive wire wound around a magnetic core, creating a magnetic field that interacts with Earth's magnetic field to generate a torque for attitude control or desaturating reaction wheels [(00:12:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=750s).
- Magnetorquers are reliable due to having no moving parts but only work in relatively low orbits where the Earth's magnetic field is sufficiently strong [(00:12:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=774s).

## Propulsion System
- Another option for attitude control is using the propulsion system to fire thrusters, with common methods of propulsion including cold gas propulsion, chemical propulsion, and electric propulsion [(00:13:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=785s).
- The principle thrust is generated by accelerating mass through a nozzle, with the simplest form of propulsion being the cold gas thruster, which is the controlled expansion of a stored pressurized gas through thruster nozzles [(00:13:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=817s).
- Higher thrust can be generated with chemical propulsion, which uses a controlled chemical reaction in a monopropellant system, where the propellant is a liquid that decomposes into a hot gas when it comes into contact with a catalyst [(00:14:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=849s).
- Bipropellant systems use two propellants, a fuel and an oxidizer, which are mixed and ignited in a combustion chamber, producing exhaust gases that are expelled through the nozzle to generate thrust [(00:14:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=877s).
- Electric propulsion uses electrical energy to generate thrust by ionizing a propellant, often a gas like [Xenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon), and then using electric and magnetic fields to accelerate the ions to high velocities before expelling them through a nozzle [(00:14:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=895s).
- The propulsion system is selected based on the thrust requirements and the mass of the satellite, with by propellent systems being complex but offering high thrust, useful for large satellites [(00:15:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=916s).
- Monopropellant systems have lower thrust but simpler system design, electric propulsion has lower thrust than the chemical propulsion options but is very efficient, requiring less propellant, and cold gas thrusters offer low thrust but very simple design and precise control [(00:15:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=927s).

## Communication System
- The communication system is of vital importance, with two separate capabilities: downlink and telemetry, tracking, and command, used to beam data generated by the payload down to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) [(00:15:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=958s).
- Satellites transmit information to ground stations using electromagnetic waves, characterized by their wavelength and frequency, with satellite communications using electromagnetic waves in the radio frequency or RF part of the spectrum [(00:16:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=997s).
- The data transmitted from a satellite is essentially a stream of bits, which can have a value of either one or zero, and needs to be encoded onto a carrier signal, a continuous sinusoidal electromagnetic wave, using modulation [(00:17:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1049s).
- Modulation can be done by changing certain properties of the carrier wave, such as amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, or phase shift keying, with most high-rate communication links using one of the several forms of phase shift keying [(00:17:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1077s).
- Satellites use modulation to provide high data throughput and low error rates, with the modulated signal generated on board by the transmitter hardware, routed through switches and filters, and transmitted to the ground station via the downlink antenna [(00:18:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1107s).
- The Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C) subsystem consists of a transceiver and various filters, switches, and antennas, and uses clever engineering to fulfill its three functions: command, telemetry, and tracking [(00:19:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1141s).
- The command function allows the operations team to control the satellite by transmitting commands from the ground station, which are demodulated by the TT&C hardware and routed to the onboard computer for implementation [(00:19:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1159s).
- The telemetry function transmits housekeeping data from various sensors on the satellite down to the ground station, including temperature, power levels, and propellant levels [(00:19:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1176s).
- The tracking function provides information about the position and speed of the satellite by sending a signal to the satellite, which the transceiver receives and sends back, providing an estimate of the distance and velocity of the satellite [(00:19:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1190s).
- GPS receivers can be used to enhance tracking capabilities, allowing for more effective monitoring of position and trajectory, although this is not an option for all orbits [(00:20:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1224s).
- Antennas used to transmit and receive RF signals are a fundamental part of any communication system, and come in many different shapes and sizes [(00:20:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1237s).
- The performance of antennas can be compared by thinking about a theoretical isotropic antenna that radiates power uniformly in all directions, with real antennas engineered to focus or receive energy in specific directions [(00:20:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1247s).
- The directionality of an antenna can be visualized as a radiation pattern, and is quantified by a parameter called gain, which measures how much an antenna focuses energy in a particular direction [(00:21:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1287s).
- The antennas on a satellite are selected to optimize performance for a specific task, with downlink systems using high-gain antennas to focus the transmitted signal into a narrow beam, and TT&C systems using low-gain antennas with wider coverage to prioritize reliable communications [(00:21:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1318s).

## Thermal Control System
- Satellites face extreme temperature fluctuations in space, with surfaces exposed to direct sunlight reaching extremely high temperatures, while temperatures suddenly drop when the satellite enters Earth's shadow, making thermal control a huge challenge [(00:22:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1373s).
- Thermal control is mission-critical, as some parts of the payload need to be kept within narrow temperature ranges to function as intended, and batteries or electrical components that exceed their allowable temperature limits are at risk of failure [(00:23:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1398s).
- Thermal control systems use various technologies and engineering techniques to maintain stable temperatures, as there is no heat transfer by convection in the vacuum of space, and the only way for the satellite to exchange thermal energy with the environment is by radiation [(00:23:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1419s).
- Radiators with high emissivity coatings are used to radiate heat from the satellite, while heat pipes transport thermal energy from hot to cold areas, and thermostat-controlled electric heaters switch on at low temperatures to prevent components from getting too cold [(00:23:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1429s).
- Multi-layer insulation blankets help control temperature by reflecting solar radiation when the satellite is in sunlight and reducing radiative heat losses when the satellite is in shadow [(00:24:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1449s).
- Special paints and coatings, as well as phase change materials, absorb or release thermal energy by undergoing a phase change, and the attitude control system can contribute to thermal control by changing the direction radiators and other surfaces are facing [(00:24:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1460s).
- All these components need to work in harmony to perfectly balance absorbing, retaining, and dissipating heat to keep the satellite's temperature within acceptable ranges [(00:24:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1476s).

## Onshape
- Having access to the right design tools is important for designing hardware destined for orbit or working on experimental projects, and [Onshape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onshape) is a powerful cloud-based CAD platform that makes it quick and easy to bring designs to life [(00:25:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1512s).
- Onshape features a user-friendly interface, intuitive tools, detailed version tracking, standard part libraries, and collaborative tools that allow multiple people to work on the same assembly at the same time [(00:25:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1527s).
- Onshape also provides access to public files from other users, which is a great way to learn, and offers loads of useful training material to help users get up to speed [(00:26:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1567s).

## Promotion
- The video offers a promotion of 6 months for free [(00:26:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1609s).

## The Growing Problem of Space Debris
- Humans have filled the space around [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) with trash, including discarded rocket bodies, mission-related debris, and thousands of satellites, many of which are no longer functional, crisscrossing at high speeds just above Earth's atmosphere, increasing the probability of catastrophic in-orbit collisions [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=0s).
- The crowding of Earth's orbit is steadily increasing due to the booming space industry launching more objects into orbit than ever before, which could lead to a runaway chain reaction of collisions and fragmentation, filling Earth's orbit with so much debris that space will become unusable to humans [(00:00:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=26s).
- To fix the space debris problem, scientists and companies are working on various solutions, including trash collecting spacecraft armed with harpoons and nets, a giant cloud of metal dust, and lasers, which could halt dangerous bits of garbage in their tracks [(00:00:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=51s).
- The vast majority of human-made objects surrounding Earth are in a region called "low Earth orbit," where communication satellites, spacecraft like the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station), and a massive amount of space trash are located [(00:01:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=79s).
- The more objects put in space, the more chances they have of smashing into each other, breaking apart, and multiplying, which could lead to a theoretical cascade effect called the "[Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome)," introduced in the 1970s, warning of an uncontrollable number of catastrophic collisions [(00:01:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=93s).

## Removing Large Space Debris
- To get rid of most space debris, it needs to be slowed down enough to fall out of orbit and into Earth's atmosphere, where it burns up and is destroyed, but different sized space junk requires different approaches to do this [(00:02:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=145s).
- The biggest bits of space debris, measuring more than 10 centimeters in size, can be tracked from [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) and slowed down using tiny spacecraft that can reach these objects and guide them down to Earth's atmosphere to be destroyed [(00:02:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=157s).
- Commercial companies like Europe's [ClearSpace-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearSpace-1) and Japan's [Astroscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroscale) are working with global space agencies to demonstrate the removal of large debris sometime in the next decade [(00:02:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=179s).

## Tackling Small Debris: Sweepers and Dust Clouds
- The two smaller classifications of space debris, which come from fragmentation events like explosions and collisions, are difficult to track and require different removal methods, such as a physical sweeper placed in orbit that could catch or slow them down enough to de-orbit them [(00:03:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=191s).
- Releasing a cloud of tungsten dust on top of debris is a cost-effective solution that could weigh down the objects and drag them into Earth's atmosphere to be destroyed, but it could also contribute to space pollution [(00:03:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=229s).

## Lasers as a Solution for Medium-Sized Debris
- The sweeper and tungsten dust ideas are not practical solutions, but there is another option for dealing with space debris in the middle, which is 1 to 10 centimeters in size and presents a unique problem because it is too small to track but big enough to cause serious damage [(00:04:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=254s).
- Focusing on this range of debris would be highly effective in managing the space debris problem, according to analysis from [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA), and lasers can be used to nudge fast-moving pieces of small debris and disrupt its orbit [(00:04:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=274s).
- Lasers can direct a beam of energy and apply force to an object without making physical contact, and they could be used to knock debris into higher orbits or lower it into Earth's atmosphere to be destroyed, which is sometimes referred to as a "laser broom" [(00:04:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=281s).
- A ground-based laser system was proposed by NASA's [Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)) in 1996, and according to NASA's 2023 cost and benefit analysis, a ground- or space-based laser system would be the most cost-effective way to remove debris of 1 to 10 centimeter size [(00:05:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=303s).

## How Laser Brooms Work
- Claude Phipps, who originally proposed the idea of using lasers to deal with space debris, explains that a ground-based laser for debris removal would work by detecting a small piece of debris with a radar system and locking onto its position, then firing a near-instantaneous pulse of energy through the atmosphere [(00:05:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=346s).
- A space-based laser would work similarly, but with a more favorable angle to shoot debris downward into Earth's atmosphere, and without the need to correct for Earth's atmosphere or long distances, making it potentially more efficient [(00:06:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=375s).
- However, a space-based laser would not have access to Earth's power grid and would be more difficult to maintain, whereas a ground-based laser would be cheaper but have a less favorable geometry [(00:06:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=396s).
- A laser system could also be highly effective for dealing with large debris by nudging it out of the way of a spacecraft's orbit when an incoming collision is detected, which would be more cost-effective and potentially safer than other methods [(00:06:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=416s).

## Developing and Implementing Laser Technology
- The technology to develop ground- and space-based lasers to fight space debris is available, but the main obstacle is a lack of financial commitment, as it is not a question of knowing what to do, but rather people committing to it [(00:07:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=450s).
- There are commercial companies around the world working on this technology, and a future with ground- and space-based laser systems cleaning up space debris may not be far away, with companies like EX-Fusion and [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) potentially developing laser broom technology [(00:07:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=458s).

## Legal and International Cooperation Challenges
- International space law currently forbids any body from touching an object in space that it didn't launch, which means that even if a laser broom is developed, it cannot be used on a dead satellite from another country, and this issue needs to be resolved by lawyers [(00:07:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=471s).
- Cleaning up space debris will require an international effort and cooperation from commercial actors like [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX), and it is not just about removing existing debris, but also about preventing the creation of new debris [(00:08:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=494s).

## Preventing Future Debris and Mitigation Efforts
- The European Space Agency's Zero Debris Charter and the US FCC's new rule requiring US-based spacecraft to de-orbit themselves within five years of mission's end are examples of efforts to mitigate space debris by preventing the creation of new debris [(00:08:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=503s).
- A combination of remediation and mitigation efforts is projected to make serious progress in battling the space debris problem, and it is essential for everyone using space as a resource to change their habit of littering before it's too late [(00:08:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKpMmBDtZo&t=531s).

# How do we take space debris out of orbit?
![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VbEjYyu1H5M/maxresdefault.jpg)


- After 60 years of [Space Activities Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Activities_Bill), approximately 8,000 tons of human-made objects crowd near Earth's space, with 6,300 tons being dead satellites and [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) posing a great risk to the use of space [(00:00:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEjYyu1H5M&t=6s).
- The volume of debris would continue to grow even if no new launches were made, due to future breakups and collisions, making it essential to remove large items of debris from space to prevent a chain reaction [(00:00:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEjYyu1H5M&t=24s).
- The Clean Space's e.Deorbit mission aims to catch and dispose of a derelict ESA-owned satellite, a world-first mission that presents many challenges, such as grabbing onto a spinning object without crashing [(00:00:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEjYyu1H5M&t=42s).
- To capture the debris, investigators are considering methods such as using a net or a robotic arm, with the final method selected needing to secure the debris target firmly for safe disposal [(00:01:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEjYyu1H5M&t=79s).
- The chosen capture method must allow for the debris to be dragged down to burn up safely during re-entry, requiring precise movement and synchronization with the spinning object [(00:01:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEjYyu1H5M&t=74s).
- The success of this mission would pave the way for a cleaner space, with the world's first active debris removal mission setting a precedent for future debris removal efforts [(00:01:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEjYyu1H5M&t=95s).

# DÉBRIS SPATIAUX : une POUBELLE en orbite ? - LDDE
![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cGwIA00klc0/maxresdefault.jpg)



## Introduction
- L'humanité est capable de satelliser des objets depuis plus de 60 ans, ce qui a conduit à des découvertes scientifiques inestimables et de grands moments d'histoire [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=0s).
- Le nombre de lancements orbitaux a connu un rythme élevé dans les années 60 et 70, puis un ralentissement avec la fin de la guerre froide, mais il est à nouveau à la hausse depuis quelques années, avec plus de 110 fusées lancées en 2018 [(00:00:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=22s).
- Les activités spatiales ont généré des dizaines de milliers de débris artificiels dans le proche voisinage de la Terre, comprenant des satellites arrivés en fin de vie, des étages de fusée et des fragments de toutes sortes [(00:00:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=51s).
- Les débris peuvent être mortels pour les satellites, même un simple boulon lancé à 28000 km/h peut causer des dégâts importants, et il y a déjà eu quelques accidents, comme la collision entre le satellite militaire français Ceriz et un morceau de fusée en 1996 [(00:01:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=73s).

## Essais d'armes antisatellites et risques de collision
- Les essais d'arme antisatellite menés par les États-Unis, la Chine et l'Inde ont également contribué à la création de grandes quantités de microébris [(00:01:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=109s).
- Les satellites doivent parfois brûler leur carburant pour éviter les collisions, comme c'est le cas pour le satellite Lesa criosat 2, et l'armée américaine émet une vingtaine d'avertissements pour des risques de collision en orbite chaque jour [(00:02:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=132s).
- L'avenir ne semble pas très réjouissant, car les lancements sont de plus en plus nombreux et chacun d'entre eux emporte en moyenne de plus en plus de satellites, ce qui est en partie dû à la révolution des smallsat [(00:02:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=161s).

## L'avenir des débris spatiaux et les smallsats
- Des entreprises comme [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX) et Amazon pourraient lancer plusieurs dizaines de milliers de satellites, ce qui pourrait aggraver le problème des débris spatiaux [(00:03:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=180s).
- Les objets artificiels en orbite terrestre devront se faire une place dans un environnement déjà bien chargé au cours de la prochaine décennie, avec environ 16000 objets artificiels dans l'orbite basse et près de 3000 objets humains dans l'orbite géostationnaire [(00:03:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=185s).
- Le principal problème est que les trajectoires de tous ces objets ne sont pas connus avec précision, ce qui rend difficile la gestion de l'espace, notamment avec l'arrivée de nouvelles universités et start-up qui lancent des satellites sans respecter la réglementation [(00:03:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=187s).

## Coopération et lignes directrices pour la gestion des débris spatiaux
- La coopération entre les différents acteurs présents en orbite est essentielle pour éviter les collisions, et le comité interagence de coordination des débris spatiaux offre des lignes directrices pour mitiger le problème, telles que la dépressurisation des containers d'un satellite arrivé en fin de vie [(00:04:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=259s).
- Le comité recommande également d'abaisser suffisamment l'orbite des satellites pour qu'ils se consument dans l'atmosphère en moins de 25 ans, mais il ne s'agit que de lignes directrices et aucune sanction n'est prévue contre un acteur qui ne le respecte pas [(00:05:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=303s).

## Le problème mondial des débris spatiaux et le syndrome de Kessler
- Les débris spatiaux représentent un excellent exemple d'un problème qui bénéficierait d'une solution mondiale, car l'enjeu est de taille et il est possible que l'humanité perde complètement l'usage de l'orbite terrestre dans les pires des scénarios, notamment avec le syndrome de Kessler qui imagine une réaction en chaîne de collisions [(00:05:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=324s).

## Saturation des orbites basses et constellations de satellites
- Les orbites les plus basses sont régulièrement nettoyées par les couches résiduelles de l'atmosphère, ce qui présente un risque relativement faible [(00:06:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=366s).
- La couche située entre 900 et 1200 km d'altitude approche dangereusement la saturation en raison des constellations de satellites comme OneWeb et [Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink), qui totalisent plus de 4900 satellites [(00:06:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=372s).
- Les satellites de OneWeb et Starlink devraient se soumettre à des contraintes drastiques pour éviter la pollution spatiale, notamment en réservant une partie de leur carburant pour la désorbitation après leur fin de vie [(00:06:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=396s).
- La désorbitation des satellites après leur fin de vie est cruciale pour éviter l'accumulation de débris spatiaux, mais il est encore incertain si cela sera suffisant pour prévenir les accidents [(00:06:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=410s).

## Stratégies de nettoyage actif de l'orbite
- Des stratégies de nettoyage actif de l'orbite sont en cours de développement, notamment en se concentrant sur les plus gros débris qui présentent le plus grand risque de démarrer une réaction en chaîne [(00:07:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=424s).
- Des tests sont en cours pour démontrer la capacité à capturer et à désorbiter les débris spatiaux, comme le satellite RemoveDebris qui a démontré sa capacité à capturer de petites cibles à l'aide d'un filet et d'un harpon [(00:07:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=449s).
- L'[European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) (Lesa) réfléchit à une mission pour désorbiter un ancien satellite à l'aide d'un filet ou d'un bras robotique, ce qui constituerait une première [(00:07:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=468s).

## Réparation, ravitaillement et déviation des débris
- D'autres acteurs réfléchissent à des vaisseaux spécialisés dans la réparation et le ravitaillement des satellites pour augmenter leur durée de vie et diminuer les besoins de nouveaux lancements [(00:08:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=482s).
- La Chine a proposé d'utiliser un laser de forte puissance en orbite pour dévier certains débris et accélérer leur rentrée dans l'atmosphère [(00:08:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=494s).

## Pollution atmosphérique et matériaux exotiques
- L'industrie spatiale est également responsable d'une certaine pollution de l'atmosphère terrestre en raison des produits de combustion toxiques libérés par certains lanceurs, comme les lanceurs russes Proton [(00:08:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=520s).
- L'industrie spatiale utilise des matériaux exotiques, dont certains sont radioactifs, et a déjà connu des incidents impliquant des RTG ou des réacteurs nucléaires qui sont rentrés dans l'atmosphère, nécessitant des opérations de décontamination longues et coûteuses [(00:09:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=562s).
- Les débris spatiaux ne disparaissent pas par magie, mais brûlent et les produits de ces combustions se retrouvent directement dans l'atmosphère, ce qui pourrait avoir un impact notable sur l'environnement [(00:09:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=545s).

## Impact environnemental de l'industrie spatiale
- L'industrie spatiale a un impact sur l'environnement, et en seulement 60 ans, un nombre incroyable d'objets artificiels a été mis sur orbite, dont la majorité ne sont plus d'aucune utilité et représentent un risque [(00:09:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=580s).
- Les mégaconstellations qui devraient apparaître à partir de 2019 ne feront qu'aggraver le problème des débris spatiaux, et il faudra rester vigilant pour éviter les collisions et un éventuel syndrome de Kessler [(00:09:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=589s).
- Il sera intéressant de quantifier l'impact des activités de lancement sur l'effet de serre ou la couche d'ozone terrestre, pour éviter que les aventures humaines vers la Lune ou la planète rouge se fassent au détriment de la planète bleue [(00:10:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGwIA00klc0&t=607s).

# Comment en finir avec les débris spatiaux qui menacent toute future conquête spatiale
![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q7IerRMAcno/hqdefault.jpg)



## Introduction aux débris spatiaux
- Les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) sont des objets minuscules mais hyper dangereux qui se trouvent au-dessus de nos têtes et peuvent causer des dégâts importants en raison de leur vitesse orbitale, qui peut atteindre 800 mètres par seconde, ce qui équivaut à environ 30 kilomètres à l'heure [(00:00:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=23s).
- La particularité des débris spatiaux est qu'ils peuvent avoir la même énergie qu'un objet beaucoup plus grand en raison de leur vitesse, par exemple une bille de 1 mm peut avoir la même énergie qu'une boule de bowling à 100 kilomètres à l'heure [(00:00:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=39s).
- Il y a environ 8000 tonnes de débris spatiaux qui se trouvent dans l'espace au-dessus de nos têtes, ce qui peut sembler peu, mais cela suffit pour faire trembler tout le milieu spatial [(00:01:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=62s).
- Les chances d'un satellite d'être touché par un débris spatial ont augmenté au fil des ans, passant de 5 % au début des années 2000 à 9,3 % aujourd'hui, en raison de l'augmentation du nombre de satellites et du manque de nettoyage de l'espace [(00:01:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=75s).

## Le syndrome de Kessler
- Le syndrome de Kessler est une réaction en chaîne cauchemardesque qui se produit lorsque la régénération de débris épars par collision est supérieure au nettoyage naturel de l'atmosphère, ce qui pourrait entraîner une augmentation exponentielle du nombre d'objets dans l'espace [(00:01:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=110s).
- Les agences spatiales prennent très au sérieux le syndrome de Kessler et travaillent sur des solutions pour nettoyer les orbites, comme des filets ou des harpons magnétiques, pour éviter que les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) ne deviennent un obstacle insurmontable pour les vaisseaux spatiaux [(00:02:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=161s).

## Aspects juridiques des débris spatiaux
- Le problème des débris spatiaux est également lié à des questions de droit, car il n'est pas clair qui a le droit de nettoyer les débris spatiaux ou de toucher à des objets qui n'appartiennent pas à leur propriétaire [(00:02:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=176s).

## La menace des débris spatiaux pour la conquête spatiale
- Les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) sont un problème majeur qui menace la conquête spatiale future, et il est essentiel de réglementer leur désorbitage pour éviter les collisions, idéalement en les faisant entrer dans le sud du Pacifique [(00:03:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=198s).
- La réglementation sur le désorbitage des satellites et des étages supérieurs est en place depuis 1995, mais elle n'est respectée que dans 20 % des cas, ce qui est un problème important [(00:03:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=204s).
- L'Inde a envoyé un missile pour détruire un satellite, ce qui est considéré comme une démarche agressive et qui rappelle que la course à l'espace est une affaire sérieuse [(00:03:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=220s).

## L'augmentation de la densité de satellites et les méga-constellations
- La densité de satellites va augmenter de manière incroyable dans les années à venir, avec plus de 1600 satellites et 10 constellations, ce qui va créer des problèmes de circulation dans l'espace [(00:04:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=243s).
- Les méga-constellations, comme celle de Space X qui promet de déployer 4425 satellites, sont l'un des problèmes potentiels, car elles vont créer des embouteillages dans l'espace [(00:04:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=270s).

## Nécessité d'une réglementation internationale
- La réglementation internationale est nécessaire pour éviter les collisions et les [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), mais il est difficile de faire respecter les règles par tous les acteurs de l'espace [(00:04:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=287s).

## Conséquences de l'accumulation des débris spatiaux
- La Station spatiale internationale doit déjà effectuer 3 à 4 manœuvres d'évitement par an pour éviter les débris spatiaux, et si les débris s'accumulent, l'espace va devenir de plus en plus dangereux [(00:04:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=298s).

## L'aspect économique de la pollution spatiale
- Les opérateurs spatiaux vont bientôt comprendre que la pollution de l'espace est un problème économique important et qu'il est nécessaire de prendre des mesures pour la prévenir [(00:05:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=313s).

## Les anomalies et la création de nouveaux débris
- Les anomalies, comme la désintégration soudaine d'un étage de fusée en 2019, peuvent créer de nouveaux [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) et aggraver le problème [(00:05:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=325s).

## Appel à un comportement exemplaire des acteurs spatiaux
- Il est essentiel que tous les acteurs de l'espace se comportent de manière exemplaire pour éviter les collisions et les débris spatiaux, car les robots nettoyeurs ne seront pas suffisants pour résoudre le problème [(00:05:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7IerRMAcno&t=347s).

# 4 Ways To Capture Space Debris
![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VIeRpePrWN8/maxresdefault.jpg)



## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=0s)
- The [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) is currently orbited by more than 160 million man-made pieces of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), consisting of materials such as steel, aluminium, and paint chips, traveling at 23 times faster than the speed of sound [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=0s).
- If space debris continues to accumulate, it could lead to the creation of a Kessler effect, which is a continuously colliding debris field that would make it impossible for satellites to survive and spaceships to escape, potentially trapping humans on Earth [(00:00:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=11s).
- The increasing amount of space debris poses a significant threat to space exploration and satellite technology, highlighting the need for effective solutions to address this issue [(00:00:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=13s).
- Four potential methods for capturing space debris are being explored, aiming to mitigate the risks associated with the growing amount of space trash and prevent a catastrophic scenario [(00:00:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=23s).

## Overview [(00:00:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=35s)
- Humans have made significant progress in space travel over the past 50 years, including putting a man on the moon, building permanent [Space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station), and creating a network of satellites that are vital to many terrestrial technologies and economies [(00:00:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=42s).
- The accumulation of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) has become a major issue, with over 23,000 pieces of debris larger than a baseball and approximately 500,000 pieces the size of a marble currently in orbit, according to [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) and the [United States Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense) [(00:01:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=66s).
- Space debris poses a significant threat to spacecraft and satellites, as even small pieces of debris can cause significant damage due to their high speeds of up to 20 kilometers per second [(00:01:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=83s).
- The problem of space debris is exacerbated by events such as China's 2007 test of an anti-satellite missile, which added over 3,500 pieces of trackable debris to Earth's orbit [(00:01:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=107s).
- If left unchecked, the amount of space debris could lead to a catastrophic event known as the [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome), where collisions between debris create a runaway cycle of collisions, making space inhospitable to satellites and untraversable by spacecraft [(00:02:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=126s).
- One of the major challenges in cleaning up space debris is developing a method to dock with or capture the debris, which is often tumbling and rotating rapidly, making it difficult to map a suitable approach vector [(00:02:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=144s).
- The industry of removing space debris is estimated to be worth approximately $1.4 billion by 2028, and finding effective solutions to this problem is crucial to preventing a "space prison" and ensuring the continued use of space for scientific and economic purposes [(00:02:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=162s).

## Claw Capture [(00:02:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=171s)
- Clear Space, a Swiss-based startup that spun out from the [ETH Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich) in 2019, has developed a claw capture technology to retrieve [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), and has already secured an 86 million euro contract with the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) to launch their proof of concept mission [(00:02:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=171s).
- The Clear Space 1 spacecraft will feature a conventional chemical rocket-powered system with a purpose-built four-armed claw that will match the orbiting trajectory of a target before extending its arms and grasping onto it, with its maiden mission due to launch in 2025 targeting a [Vespa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespa), a Vega secondary payload adapter [(00:02:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=173s).
- Once the spacecraft has acquired the target object, it will vector so that it re-enters the atmosphere, causing both the spacecraft and the payload to burn up on re-entry, with a key advantage of this system being that it targets large debris objects, removing them from orbit before a collision turns them into many smaller pieces of debris [(00:02:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=176s).
- The mechanical capture of a target requires careful matching of velocities and tumbling behavior to prevent further debris generation, and the claw system sets an upper and lower size limit on the objects that can be captured, with Clear Space being selected by the [UK Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Space_Agency) to define a space mission able to remove multiple defunct satellites from orbit as of October 27, 2021 [(00:02:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=177s).
- The UK Space Agency's initiative is driving development in two critical areas needed for commercially viable debris removal: multi-removal missions and refueling, with Clear Space's technology being a key part of this effort [(00:03:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=182s).
- The Clear Space 1 mission will demonstrate the effectiveness of the claw capture technology in removing large debris objects from orbit, and will help to pave the way for future debris removal missions [(00:03:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=189s).

## Magnetic Capture [(00:04:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=270s)
- [Astroscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroscale), a [Japanese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language) company, is developing a magnetic tugboat debris capture system that aims to match the orbit trajectory of a satellite or debris candidate and magnetically dock to either complete repairs on a satellite or push the debris into the atmosphere so it burns up [(00:04:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=272s).
- The company proposes that all satellites can be pre-engineered with a lightweight magnetic docking plate to make the capture process more reliable, which would enable easy docking with minimal chance of damaging or creating further debris, although this system may not be as effective for collecting existing objects without these plates [(00:04:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=274s).
- Astroscale successfully demonstrated its capability to capture a client object in a trial run through the End-of-Life Services by Astroscale demonstration mission on August 25, 2021, which showed the potential of the magnetic capture system [(00:04:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=278s).
- As of October 26, 2021, Astroscale Limited, the UK subsidiary of Astroscale, was awarded a [UK Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Space_Agency) bid to study the removal of two further defunct satellites from space as part of their Cosmic programme, which involves cleaning out space through innovative capture methods [(00:04:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=280s).
- The magnetic capture system has the potential to be used for both repairing satellites and removing debris from space, with the goal of reducing the amount of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) in orbit and preventing further collisions [(00:04:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=282s).
- The use of magnetic docking plates would allow for a more efficient and safe capture process, reducing the risk of damage to the satellite or the capture system, and minimizing the creation of further debris [(00:04:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=284s).

## Remove Debris [(00:05:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=337s)
- The [RemoveDEBRIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RemoveDEBRIS) project, pioneered by [Surrey Satellite Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_Satellite_Technology), is a space debris removal approach that utilizes a tethered harpoon and a weighted net casting system, designed by [Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus), to capture debris in space [(00:05:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=340s).
- The Remove Debris system features a net system that can capture targets, such as a cubesat, which is a common type of small satellite, by firing a space net that wraps around and entangles the target, and then reels it in using a motor-driven winch [(00:06:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=361s).
- The project also includes a harpoon system, which consists of a 1.5 meter boom that deploys from the satellite platform, firing a special purpose-made harpoon at 20 meters per second to penetrate the target and lock it in place via a tether attached to the spacecraft [(00:06:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=387s).
- The key advantages of the Remove Debris systems, including the net and harpoon, are that they are capable of capturing very large pieces of debris without having to match the tumbling properties of the debris object, although they risk small pieces of debris separating from the larger structure [(00:06:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=402s).

## Laser Broom [(00:06:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=417s)
- The laser broom is a method for capturing [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), with companies like Electro-Orbit Systems (EOS), an [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) company, having experience in developing laser systems for use in the aviation and defense industries [(00:06:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=418s).
- High energy laser pulse radiation may be the most feasible means to mitigate the threat of a collision with a [Space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station) or other high-value space asset with orbital debris in the sizes of 1 to 10 centimeters [(00:07:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=430s).
- Under laser irradiation, part of the debris material is ablated or heated, providing an impulse to the debris particle, which can either deflect the object's trajectory away from the high-value asset or slow the debris into an intercept course with the upper atmosphere where it ultimately burns up [(00:07:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=444s).
- The idea would be that this laser system would scan across the sky systematically, removing debris targets out of the trajectory of high-value space assets, with most research concentrating on ground-based laser systems [(00:07:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=464s).
- Ground-based laser systems are preferred over arming satellites with laser systems, as the latter is generally seen as militarizing space, but ground-mounted approaches have to deal with atmospheric distortions that may make reliably targeting small objects difficult [(00:07:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=472s).
- This system could be used quickly to target many pieces of debris, servicing multiple objects much more quickly than physically capturing them ever could, and having some control over where the debris lands is probably preferable [(00:08:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=489s).
- Technically, all objects orbiting the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) will crash back down through the atmosphere given enough time, but having some control over the process is critical to explore space in a sustainable way and prevent the debris from building up [(00:08:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=500s).

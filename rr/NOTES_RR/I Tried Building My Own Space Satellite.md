## SATGUS: The Space Selfie Satellite  
- The custom-made artificial satellite, named **SATGUS**, will be hurtling through space at **8 kilometers per second** in about a month. What makes **SATGUS** special is that it carries a **smartphone** and a **camera**—its sole purpose is to take your **selfie in space**, with the entire **Earth** as your backdrop. [(00:00:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=3s)  
To build a machine and send it into space, six steps are required.  
- **Step 1:** Design your satellite using **CAD** (Computer-Aided Design) before proceeding with other processes. [(00:00:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=53s)  
- SATGUS adopts a CubeSat design. About 25 years ago, two professors at Stanford University discovered that most artificial satellites require some of the same basic components, such as solar panels, radio communication devices, and computers. [(00:01:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=83s)  
- The structure of SATGUS includes hardware necessary for maintaining the satellite's basic functions, such as computers, all located in one area, while the remaining space is reserved for the payload. This is the functional zone of the artificial satellite, where you can put whatever you want. [(00:01:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=116s)  

## Steps to Build and Launch a Satellite  
- To build a machine and send it into space, six steps are required. The first step is to design your satellite using CAD, which stands for Computer-Aided Design, before proceeding with other processes. [(00:00:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=53s)

## Components of SATGUS  
- Let’s take a look at the specific components on SATGUS. Many of these hardware components might be useful for you. First, let’s talk about its unique feature—the payload. This part will be used to take photos. Once the satellite enters space and operates normally, these two spring-loaded panels will open. [(00:02:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=143s)  
- Regarding power, we installed solar panels. The energy will be stored in several 120-watt-hour batteries. The satellite orbits the Earth every 90 minutes. If the solar panels remain facing the sun, the energy provided every 90 minutes can charge a smartphone nine times. [(00:03:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=184s)  
- To address the satellite’s rotation, a rotating wheel called a reaction wheel is used. Angular momentum is always conserved. If the reaction wheel spins in one direction, according to the laws of physics, the satellite must spin in the opposite direction to maintain balance. [(00:03:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=217s)  
- By wrapping a $2 crystalline iron rod with wires and electrifying them, a magnetic field can be created to alter the direction of a compass. However, this magnetic field must align with Earth’s magnetic field. [(00:04:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=276s)  
- To help the satellite determine its position relative to Earth, GPS, an inertial measurement unit, and two star trackers are installed. The latter will take photos of the stars and compare them with stored images to determine the satellite’s orientation. [(00:05:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=303s)  
- Since strong sunlight might prevent the star trackers from capturing the stars, two sun sensors are also installed. They assume the brightest point is the sun to achieve precise positioning. [(00:05:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=328s)  
- To communicate with the satellite, two radio devices are installed—one slow and one fast. The ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio has slow data transmission speeds and is used for basic commands and telemetry. The S-band radio has extremely fast transmission speeds and is used for photo transfers. [(00:05:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=339s)  
- The onboard computer is the brain of the satellite. It receives signals from sensors and radios and decides when the satellite should turn or take photos. [(00:05:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=356s)

## Satellite Attitude Control System  
- To address the satellite’s rotation, a rotating wheel called a reaction wheel is used. Angular momentum is always conserved. If the reaction wheel spins in one direction, according to the laws of physics, the satellite must spin in the opposite direction to maintain balance. [(00:03:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=217s)

## Onboard Computer  
- The onboard computer is the brain of the satellite. It receives signals from sensors and radios and decides when the satellite should turn or take photos. [(00:05:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=356s)  

## Deadly Threats in Space  
- There are four factors in space that can kill a satellite: intense vibrations, alternating extreme temperatures, space radiation, and asteroid impacts. Careful analysis and proper protective measures are required. [(00:06:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=370s)  
- To ensure the satellite’s hardware can withstand rocket vibrations, a finite element model is used to break down the entire model into smaller grids. The resonant frequency of each component is calculated to ensure they are all higher than the rocket’s vibration frequency. [(00:08:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=490s)  
- Extreme temperatures in space pose a threat to the satellite. Under sunlight, the satellite’s temperature can reach 100 degrees Celsius, while in shadow, it can drop to -80 degrees Celsius. [(00:08:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=534s)  
- The satellite will face extreme temperature changes in space, switching from twice the highest desert temperature to the lowest recorded temperature in Antarctica every 90 minutes. Such fluctuations can quickly freeze or overheat electronic equipment. [(00:09:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=559s)  
- To prevent electronic equipment from freezing in shadow, heaters are installed on the satellite, along with surface coatings to dissipate heat and avoid overheating in sunlight. [(00:09:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=574s)  
- The third deadly threat in space is solar radiation. One hour of direct sunlight in space is equivalent to a full year of sunlight exposure on Earth. [(00:09:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=591s)  
- To protect the satellite from radiation, critical electronic components are shielded with sufficiently thick metal or glass plates to prevent damage from solar and other sources of radiation. [(00:10:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=603s)  
- By simulating the harsh space environment in a radiation chamber, the radiation resistance of the Google Pixel phone was tested. It was found that 6 mm thick aluminum plates and 5 mm thick radiation-resistant glass are needed to ensure the satellite’s safety. [(00:10:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=623s)  
- This project received strong support from Google Pixel and T-Mobile. The Google Pixel phone will be used for space selfies, and T-Mobile will provide satellite signal services. [(00:10:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=652s)  
- The fourth deadly threat in space is vacuum. Rubber, foam, and lithium batteries on the satellite can expand or release gas in a vacuum, damaging other equipment. [(00:11:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=677s)  
- To prevent damage to the satellite in a vacuum, necessary protective measures must be taken, such as using pressure suits or reinforcing the satellite’s structure. [(00:11:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=691s)  
- Currently, the number of artificial satellites and other objects orbiting Earth is large, but due to the small size of satellites, the probability of collision is almost zero. [(00:12:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=729s)  
- SATGUS does not need thrusters to avoid other satellites because the probability of collision is extremely low. [(00:12:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=745s)  

## Vibration Countermeasures  
- To ensure the satellite’s hardware can withstand rocket vibrations, a finite element model is used to break down the entire model into smaller grids. The resonant frequency of each component is calculated to ensure they are all higher than the rocket’s vibration frequency. [(00:08:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=490s)

## Collision Avoidance Strategy  
- Currently, the number of artificial satellites and other objects orbiting Earth is large, but due to the small size of satellites, the probability of collision is almost zero. [(00:12:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=729s)  
- SATGUS does not need thrusters to avoid other satellites because the probability of collision is extremely low. [(00:12:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=745s)  

## Satellite Lifespan and Decommissioning  
- Any satellite entering orbit must burn up or disintegrate within a specified timeframe. SATGUS will remain active in orbit for only one to three years. [(00:12:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=774s)

## Launch Preparation and Deployment  
- After testing, the satellite is loaded into a launch dispenser for transport. Once in orbit, the dispenser remains on the rocket, and a spring mechanism gently pushes the satellite into space. [(00:17:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=1075s)  

## Launch Process  
- SATGUS will launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The launch involves multiple stages, including rocket separation and satellite deployment. [(00:18:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=1106s)  
- SpaceX was chosen as the launch provider because their prices are much lower than other companies, and booking a rocket launch on their website is very convenient. [(00:18:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=1116s)  
- To cover all locations on Earth, the satellite must follow a specific orbit—the same one used by spy satellites to monitor any point on the planet. [(00:19:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=1149s)  
- Vandenberg Space Force Base is the ideal launch site in the U.S. because the area south of the launch site must be water for safety reasons. [(00:19:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=1158s)  
- The Falcon 9’s payload fairing is large enough to fit a school bus and can carry 50 to 100 satellites, including SATGUS. [(00:19:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=1196s)  
- After launch, the rocket undergoes a thrilling sequence, including main booster separation and satellite deployment, all within about nine minutes. [(00:20:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KcV1C1Ui5s&t=1218s)

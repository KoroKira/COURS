## The Growing Threat of Orbital Debris
- The Earth's orbit is filled with thousands of satellites that are crucial to daily life, but each launch also generates debris that accumulates and poses a danger to other satellites and future space missions [(00:00:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=11s).
- Since the beginning of space exploration, the amount of waste in orbit has been increasing, and if not addressed, it will eventually become impossible to use space for satellites, threatening to turn space dreams into nightmares [(00:00:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=47s).
- Satellites are launched into space where they follow an elliptical path around the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), undertaking precise missions such as photographing the Earth, relaying signals, and spying, but they can break down or stop working when they run out of power, becoming [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) [(00:02:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=121s).
- There are nearly a million objects larger than half an inch in orbit, and being struck by orbital debris is a constant threat to all satellites, risking a significant setback to society if not addressed [(00:03:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=204s).
- The problem of orbital debris began 60 years ago with the launch of [Sputnik 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1), the world's first satellite, which stopped working after 21 days and disintegrated in the Earth's atmosphere, but its brief existence had global consequences [(00:04:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=257s).
- The space race between the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) led to a significant increase in satellite launches, including spy satellites fueled by nuclear reactors, some of which were defective and posed a risk to the environment, such as the [Russian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language) satellite [Kosmos 954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954), which scattered radioactive material over [Northern Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Canada) [(00:06:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=365s).
- The accumulation of orbital debris is a result of decades of space exploration, and it is essential to start cleaning up space to prevent a catastrophic outcome and ensure the continued use of space for satellites and future missions [(00:01:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=89s).

## Origins and Accumulation of Space Debris
- The demise of a Russian satellite in [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America) during the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War) led to the realization that [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) could pose a potential danger to the population on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), and it was noted that launching satellites into orbit also creates debris, with each rocket launch leaving behind debris in orbit [(00:07:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=457s).
- The [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) engineer, Rig Gayen, has analyzed the orbital debris created by rocket launches, and it has been found that the upper stages of a rocket, along with fuel tanks and nose cones, are systematically left in orbit, contributing to the accumulation of debris over the last 60 years [(00:08:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=510s).
- Space debris comes mainly from satellites that have been put in space and have stopped working, with historically most being left in orbit unless they are placed in a very low orbit, in which case they fall into the Earth's atmosphere, where they are mostly destroyed due to the heat generated by their high speed [(00:09:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=574s).
- However, problems arise when debris does not burn up completely in the atmosphere, and there have been instances of rocket parts crashing to Earth, such as a 550lb fuel tank in [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas) in 1997, and a nose cone in [Martinique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique) in 2011 [(00:10:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=627s).
- The estimated number of objects orbiting the Earth is around 36,000, with an additional 30,000 objects that have already fallen back to Earth, and the total mass of artificial objects in space, including satellites and debris, is approximately 9,000 tons [(00:11:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=703s).

## Satellite Orbits and Debris Distribution
- Satellites around the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) use three different orbits, with the furthest being the geostationary orbit, a thin layer 22,000 miles away, where satellites remain constantly above the same point on the Earth [(00:13:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=798s).
- Satellites in geostationary orbit, which provide telecommunications, computer link-ups, and television broadcasts, are spaced approximately 40 meters apart and need to be removed when they have served their time, with their last fuel reserves used to deorbit them to a graveyard orbit, [(00:13:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=817s).
- Medium Earth orbit, situated between 1,200 and 22,000 miles in altitude, is avoided due to the presence of radio navigation satellites like Galileo, and if one of these satellites breaks down, it is placed into an intermediate orbit to prevent interference, [(00:14:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=872s).
- [Low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit), the closest orbit to Earth, is situated below 1,200 miles in altitude and has accumulated the most debris over the past 60 years, with the only way to get rid of debris in this area being to send it into Earth's atmosphere where it disintegrates, [(00:14:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=898s).

## Satellite Malfunctions and Solar Flares
- Satellites can re-enter Earth's atmosphere with almost no risk in certain areas, such as the South Pacific, and if a satellite still has fuel, it is possible to control its movements in low, medium, and geostationary orbits, [(00:15:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=931s).
- Satellites can break down without warning, and the cause of these malfunctions is often due to natural interference with safety measures, such as solar storms, which can release huge amounts of energy and electrically charged particles into space, [(00:16:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=971s).
- Solar flares can wipe out navigation systems and destroy satellites, with an estimated dozen or so satellites being destroyed each year, turning them into [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), [(00:16:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1013s).

## The Kessler Syndrome and Collision Risks
- Space debris poses two problems: it can stay in orbit for a long time, such as 1,000 to 2,000 years, and it can move at high speeds, increasing the probability of crashing into something, [(00:17:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1075s).
- The situation with space debris has degenerated since 2007, with three major events causing an increase in debris, including the collision between the [Russian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language) satellite [Kosmos 2251](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_2251) and the American satellite [Iridium 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_33), which produced around 2,000 pieces of debris larger than 3 inches, [(00:18:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1112s).
- The collision of out-of-control objects in low orbit poses a significant danger to working satellites, as demonstrated by China's deliberate destruction of a weather satellite using a ballistic missile, which was followed by Russia's destruction of a decommissioned satellite called [Kosmos 148](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_148), resulting in 1500 pieces of large debris being scattered into low orbit [(00:19:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1190s).
- The events caused by the [Chinese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language) and Russian governments destroying satellites on purpose have highlighted the risk of collision to satellites in space, with over a million pieces of debris larger than half an inch now circling the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), including pieces from rockets and their fuel tanks [(00:21:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1289s).
- The fuel tanks of rockets can explode when liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen mix, producing nitrous oxide and creating thousands of pieces of debris that remain in orbit, contributing to the proliferation of space junk [(00:21:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1310s).
- This phenomenon is known as [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome), named after [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) consultant [Donald J. Kessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler), who described and quantified it, predicting that collisions between objects in Earth's orbit would have a cascading effect, increasing the likelihood of further collisions [(00:22:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1361s).
- Don Kessler's theory was proven accurate in 1996 when debris from an Ariane rocket launched 10 years earlier collided with a [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) military satellite, causing damage and demonstrating the potential for a chain reaction of collisions in space [(00:24:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1456s).

## Consequences of Space Debris Proliferation
- The proliferation of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) could endanger a wide range of activities on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), including satellite positioning, which is used in daily life for navigation and other purposes, highlighting the need for innovative solutions to address the issue of orbital waste [(00:25:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1511s).
- The proliferation of debris in space risks compromising satellite services, and space agencies have to take serious risks when launching satellites, including the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency), due to the possibility of conjunctions with objects [(00:25:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1559s).
- The risk of losing a satellite is now proven and quantified, with the odds of losing a satellite being 5%, part of which is the risk of being hit by debris, and the likelihood can quickly reach 10 or 20% with the increase in orbital debris [(00:26:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1614s).
- The European Space Agency estimates that the risk of collision will rise to 20% by 2038, meaning one out of every five satellites would not complete its mission, which is a huge figure [(00:27:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1637s).

## Space Surveillance and Collision Avoidance
- Space agencies have had to look at ways of negotiating this minefield and detecting the circling waste, with the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) using a space surveillance network since 1957 to predict where and when [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) will enter the Earth's atmosphere [(00:27:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1661s).
- The United States has established a catalog of the debris that is currently in orbit and uses this to determine which country owns the debris that is entering the atmosphere, and they can also warn [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) if debris is at risk of interfering with their satellites [(00:27:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1676s).
- In [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), a similar space surveillance system was not put in place until 40 years later in 1996, when the [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) Ministry of Defense created a system known as GRA, which is a space surveillance network that allows detecting objects that orbit around 250 to 600 m in altitude [(00:28:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1725s).
- The GRA system uses a particular radar that makes real-time calculations to follow and anticipate the trajectories of thousands of satellites, and it was able to detect 30 or so [Chinese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language) and American spy satellites that had not been cataloged previously [(00:29:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1746s).
- International relations in space are a mixture and an extension of those on the ground, with France agreeing to keep quiet about the spy satellites in return for access to the American orbital catalog, which is considerably more detailed than the European version [(00:29:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1795s).
- This constant space surveillance is efficient and allows civilian and military satellites to avoid collisions with orbital debris, with ground-based operators able to move their satellites slightly out of their orbit if there is a risk [(00:30:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1826s).

## Protecting the International Space Station
- The [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) is threatened by debris several times a year, and to avoid orbital collisions, it has to be moved from its course, as seen in 2012 when it avoided a piece of debris from the collision between the Iridium and Cosmos satellites [(00:30:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1854s).
- The space station is on a collision course with small pieces of space junk, and astronauts have to take it into a high orbit by turning on the engines for 37 seconds, which is the only time they can feel acceleration on board [(00:32:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1945s).
- Sometimes, the ballistic data about debris is imprecise, and the astronauts are told to evacuate the station urgently, taking refuge in the Escape module, which could be separated from the station and return the astronauts to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) [(00:33:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=1990s).
- There are around 150 million pieces of junk that are too small to be tracked by radars, and satellites and the space station need to be protected from this menace [(00:33:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2028s).

## Shielding Satellites and Astronauts from Debris
- Scientists from the [Fraunhofer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_Society) in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) test shielding material using a super-fast accelerator known as a space gun, which fires tiny metal balls at various shielding materials to reproduce conditions in space [(00:34:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2049s).
- The space gun fires the balls at speeds of up to 15,000 mph, which is necessary to study the behavior of collisions at hyper-velocity speeds, where the impact creates different physical phenomena than at lower speeds [(00:34:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2076s).
- The tests on different satellite components, such as space solar cells and tanks, are analyzed to understand and model what happens during a collision, allowing the team to come up with structures that are both light and resistant to hypervelocity impacts [(00:36:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2179s).
- The Space Gun team has found that doubling or tripling insulation layers can protect satellite components hit by debris smaller than 4 inches, with the first layer fragmenting the debris, the second dissipating its energy, and the third protecting the component [(00:37:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2220s).
- Scientists have been able to design satellites that are resistant to small debris thanks to experiments, but astronauts remain exposed to small debris during space walks, which can't be detected by Radars or seen by the human eye, and even a minor impact would puncture an astronaut's suit and lead to instant death [(00:37:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2269s).
- [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) is actively developing robots that could replace humans to accomplish maintenance operations outside the spacecraft, though even robots would be unable to withstand a collision with debris of more than half an inch [(00:38:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2304s).

## Mitigation Efforts and International Regulations
- Countries around the world have tried to establish rules for the nonproliferation of large debris, such as emptying all fuel on board their space vehicles and limiting satellites to a maximum 25-year lifespan in orbit [(00:38:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2325s).
- Satellites are equipped with systems to vent or burn excess fuel, and objects in **low** **earth** **orbit** that do not completely burn up on re-entry are steered towards broad ocean areas for their final impact, but these rules are not always respected [(00:38:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2339s).

## Cleaning Up Space: The Rise of Space Garbage Collectors
- The amount of junk in space is increasing, and we're generating debris faster than it can be cleaned out by the atmosphere, creating an unsustainable environment, and the only real solution to this problem is to clean out the debris that is orbiting around the earth [(00:39:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2390s).
- Based on the Polla pay principle, each country is supposed to finance the elimination of its own debris, and since 2013, Space Engineers have been creating a new profession, space garbage collectors, who come up with robotic systems that can deal with large pieces of garbage [(00:40:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2417s).
- Researchers are working on robot satellites that could capture debris and deorbit it, such as the Remove Debris project at the space center in England, which is testing technologies like the [Harpoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpoon), a system capable of attaching onto a piece of debris and dragging it into the atmosphere [(00:41:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2464s).
- The team is still at the experimental stage, testing a miniature harpoon on a stationary target, and the first full-scale test in space in 2019 was a success, with hopes that the system will improve when it goes into space due to the lack of gravity [(00:42:28)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2548s).
- The first full-scale tests in space for improving systems will take place in 2020, and one of the tools envisioned is the Harpoon, but the [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa) space agency has also come up with its own cleaning solutions, including a project called [Medusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa), which is a small satellite capable of unfolding its tentacles to capture debris [(00:42:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2574s).
- Medusa will enclose the debris and drag it to where it needs to be, either to a grave orbit or to decrease its altitude and eventually toss the debris back into the atmosphere, and one of the advantages of the Medusa satellites is that they can be launched in squadrons, which keeps costs down [(00:43:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2585s).
- Medusa is designed to be put onto [CubeSat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat), which are small multi-use satellites in the shape of a 4in cube, developed by Californian University, and dozens of them can be launched at a time, making it a cost-effective solution for researchers [(00:43:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2629s).
- The Medusa satellite is very light, weighing about 175g, and is designed to eliminate debris over a long period, but it only targets small space junk, and for large non-functioning satellites, other tools are necessary, which opens up the problem of financing these operations [(00:43:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2631s).

## Tackling Large Debris: The Case of Envisat
- One of the largest non-operational pieces of debris is the [Envisat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envisat) observation satellite, which was launched in 2002 by the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) and is the size of a bus, but after losing control of it in 2012, it is now a ticking time bomb as it crosses paths with many other working satellites [(00:45:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2731s).
- The European Space Agency is funding an ambitious program to try and remove Envisat from its orbit, and one of the options being considered is throwing a net, which would allow for a connection by a tether and the captured satellite to be pulled, and to test this, space engineers are using an aircraft to recreate space's zero gravity conditions [(00:47:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2826s).
- The tests have proved that adding weight to the corners of the net allows it to enclose the body of a satellite without snagging on its fragile solar panels, and the net is being designed to catch an 8-ton satellite like Envisat [(00:47:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2850s).
- A tractor satellite is needed to retrieve Envisat, an 8-ton satellite, and return it to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), which is a challenging task due to the satellite's heavy weight, requiring a more stable scenario by pulling rather than pushing [(00:48:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2895s).
- The project to remove Envisat is still in the theoretical stages, with an estimated cost of half a billion euros, and no robot garbage collector is currently ready for the task [(00:48:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2929s).

## Space Tugs: A Promising Solution for Debris Removal
- Space tugs are being considered as a promising solution, which would be multi-functional, acting as a space-based Swiss army knife, capable of refilling, repairing, inspecting, and maintaining satellites, as well as collecting space junk [(00:49:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=2961s).
- However, technological problems remain, such as developing autonomous technologies that can manage scheduled rendezvous with targets that have not been designed for this purpose, like old satellites or [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) [(00:50:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3001s).
- The space tug project is still being studied, but with major funding, the first efficient cleaning service may come into use by 2025, with the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) and private companies like One Web already investing in the project [(00:50:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3044s).

## Mega Constellations and the Future of Space Debris
- Private companies are launching thousands of satellites into **low** **Earth** **orbit** to create [Satellite internet constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_internet_constellation), such as SpaceX's [Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) and One Web, aiming to provide internet access to remote parts of the globe [(00:51:03)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3063s).
- The number of Mega constellation satellites in orbit is expected to exceed the number of satellites launched since the beginning of the Space Race, raising concerns among space specialists about the potential risks and consequences [(00:52:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3125s).
- By 2030, it is estimated that there will be around 100,000 new satellites in orbit, with companies like [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX) and One Web planning to launch thousands of satellites, which requires careful consideration of the potential implications [(00:52:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3154s).

## The Need for Space Traffic Management and Regulation
- The regulatory environment for space needs to be established to ensure the long-term use of space for Humanity, considering deorbit operations and the imposition of a space traffic system, similar to the one in Aviation, to prevent space from being filled with more garbage [(00:52:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3170s).
- [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) is a significant concern, as satellites can break down and circle around as junk, and the lack of international regulations in place poses a problem, especially with the increasing number of satellites being sent into space [(00:53:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3205s).
- The absence of a global body to regulate space debris is a concern, as different groups and countries have varying thoughts on regulation, but no concrete actions have been taken to address the issue [(00:54:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3270s).
- The future of the space industry is promising, but the state of space orbits is worrying, with more players, including smaller nations and private companies, putting satellites into orbit, increasing the risk of orbital debris [(00:54:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3290s).
- Satellite operators are concerned about orbital debris, and although few people on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) are aware of the problem, it could soon have a significant impact on daily life, highlighting the need for a solution, such as the "Polla pays" rule, to be applied to space [(00:55:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3311s).
- The lack of control and management of satellites during the deorbit phase is a concern, and the increasing number of satellites in space, including mega constellation satellites, poses a risk of failures and additional space debris [(00:53:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgZqxLsp8Yc&t=3229s).

# Space debris: A problem thatâ€™s only getting bigger

- There are currently over 128 million objects larger than a millimeter orbiting the earth, transforming the space around it into a junkyard, and even a small piece of cosmic junk traveling at high speeds can be catastrophic to many satellites [(00:00:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=18s).
- The number of satellites in earth's orbit has increased drastically over the past few years, with over 11,400 satellites launched, and only 3,370 of them are currently active, while the rest are inactively floating in orbit [(00:00:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=51s).
- Several companies, including [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX), [Amazon (company)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)), and China's Hongyan, are planning to launch thousands of satellites into the earth's orbit, which can lead to a disaster and increase the chances of collisions between high-speed objects [(00:01:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=91s).
- The first documented collision involving [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) happened in 1996, and in 2009, a US commercial satellite collided with an inactive Russian communications satellite, creating over 2,300 pieces of space shrapnel [(00:01:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=107s).
- The Kessler syndrome, coined by [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) scientist [Donald J. Kessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler), describes the phenomenon where collisions between high-speed objects in orbit create thousands of pieces of debris, leading to a chain reaction that can make the earth's orbit unusable [(00:02:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=176s).
- To stop the orbital junk generating chain reaction, techniques such as dragging parts of space junk down into the earth's atmosphere or using a net or harpoon to capture space-borne garbage are being developed and tested [(00:03:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=197s).
- The [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) has awarded a contract to a [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) startup to retrieve a 220-pound piece of rocket debris that has been orbiting the earth since 2013, scheduled for 2025, which will utilize four robotic arms to capture the debris [(00:03:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=221s).
- However, these methods are only useful for larger pieces of junk, and there isn't a way to pick up smaller pieces of debris, so all that can be done is wait for them to re-enter the earth's atmosphere naturally [(00:04:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=240s).
- If nothing changes and the amount of debris continues to grow, it will pose a risk to future space missions, and it's only a matter of time before more collisions occur, making it nearly impossible to clean up the low earth orbit [(00:04:14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=254s).
- Without innovative solutions, the only option will be to rely on a network of ground and satellite-based observatories to watch and monitor the skies [(00:04:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQnv_IWttw&t=273s).

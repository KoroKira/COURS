Before diving into the main topic, let me take a moment to introduce myself. My name is Guilhem, and I am currently a student at ICAM. Since childhood, I have always been fascinated by space—the planets, stars, and the mysteries of the universe. This passion naturally led me to pursue a career in the aerospace industry.

Today, I have the privilege of working at Thales Alenia Space as a full-stack developer. Although my role focuses more on software development than on the satellites themselves, I remain deeply interested in the broader field of satellite technology. When the opportunity arose to join a company specializing in aerospace innovation, I didn’t hesitate for a second.

I must admit, since this event is sponsored by Airbus, it might have been even more exciting if I were part of Airbus Defense & Space. Who knows—maybe one day, if the company merger happens, I’ll have the chance to experience that too! But let’s not get sidetracked.

The reason I’m here today is to discuss a critical issue: satellite waste and how companies manage the full lifecycle of satellites.

The topic of satellite waste is increasingly important in our times, as space becomes more crowded and the number of satellites continues to grow. Interestingly, some forward-thinking companies began addressing these challenges as early as the 2000s, recognizing the potential consequences of "overcrowded space." In fact, the concept of this issue can be traced back to the early days of the space race.

The first recorded concern about "space overcrowding" dates back to 1961, just four years after the launch of Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite. That year, E. E. Peterkin, from the Operational Research Branch at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, published a memorandum titled "Some Characteristics of the Artificial Earth Satellite Population." He predicted that the catalogued population of objects in space would increase by 318 objects per year.

While Peterkin's work in 1961 marked the beginning of formal discussions on the topic, the problem of space debris has grown dramatically since then. A significant milestone was NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler's proposition of the "Kessler syndrome" in 1978, which highlights how cascading collisions in space could result in an unusable orbital environment.

To provide some perspective on the scale of this issue, let me ask you a quick question: do you know how many satellites are currently orbiting above us?

According to data from SatelliteTracker3D, there are approximately 25,000 objects in space, including both active satellites and debris. Among these, Orbit.ing.org reports that 11,884 objects are still active (this figure should be verified). With some quick math, this means about 13,116 satellites are non-functional yet still orbiting above us. That’s a staggering number—but numbers like these can be difficult to grasp due to their sheer scale.

To put this into perspective, imagine we launched all 25,000 satellites within a single year—from zero to the current total. This would mean deploying around 68 satellites each day, an enormous figure. In this hypothetical scenario, within just 173 days—less than half a year—we would stop launching functional satellites and exclusively send defunct ones into space. It’s hard to fathom such rapid accumulation, but it highlights the vast quantity of orbital debris currently above us.

This is why discussing satellite waste and lifecycle management is so vital. But before diving deeper into the topic, let me pose a question: do you know how a satellite “dies”? While it might seem like a strange question, it’s an essential one. Let me explain.

A satellite reaches the end of its life when it runs out of fuel or can no longer maintain its orbit. This can happen for various reasons: mechanical failure, collisions with space debris, or simply reaching the end of its operational lifespan. Companies generally set benchmarks to determine when a satellite’s performance no longer meets their quality standards and decide when to retire it.

For example, at Thales Alenia Space (TAS), satellites are typically designed to operate for about 20 years. After this period, their performance is no longer considered reliable enough to meet high-quality standards, although they may still function. In contrast, Starlink satellites, designed for mass deployment, have a much shorter lifespan of around 5 years. Experts have observed that their quality is both cost-effective and rapidly diminishes over time. This significant difference in lifecycle reflects varying design philosophies and raises important questions about satellite quality and waste.

Understanding these differences is crucial when discussing satellite waste, lifecycle management, and the responsibility of aerospace companies in maintaining sustainable practices. Some companies prioritize long-term reliability, while others focus on volume and cost reduction, which directly impacts the growing issue of orbital debris.


The difference in satellite life expectancy is straightforward to explain. In Europe, we focus on building exceptional, high-quality satellites—masterpieces of engineering, tailored for each specific mission. Each satellite is unique and meticulously crafted by experts at every stage. This personalized approach naturally reflects in the cost of the satellite, but the price is justified by its superior quality and reliability.

In contrast, new players in the aerospace industry, particularly in the USA and China—Starlink being a notable example—have taken a more industrialized approach. Their strategy involves mass-producing satellites as cost-effectively as possible. These satellites, often of lower quality, are launched in vast quantities. The idea is simple: if one satellite fails, it’s not a significant issue because hundreds or even thousands more are available. This approach prioritizes quantity over quality, often overlooking the environmental and long-term consequences, such as what happens to the satellite at the end of its life.

When a satellite reaches the end of its operational life, there are currently three primary methods for managing it:

Re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere: This involves intentionally de-orbiting the satellite so it burns up upon re-entry. However, this method is not without issues, as it releases toxic heavy metals into the atmosphere and can contribute to the destruction of the ozone layer. For instance, Starlink satellites re-enter the atmosphere at an alarming rate of approximately 120 per month, each producing 30 kg of aluminum oxide. This compound significantly damages the ozone layer, and its atmospheric concentration has increased eightfold since 2016. These figures are catastrophic, and that’s just one company’s contribution. The combined impact across the industry is staggering.

Graveyard orbit: Another method involves moving defunct satellites to a graveyard orbit—a distant region of space where they are unlikely to interfere with active missions. While this may seem like a reasonable solution, it is not permanent. Over time, this orbit will also become overcrowded, creating additional risks and challenges.

Abandonment in orbit: The worst-case scenario occurs when a satellite is simply left in its current orbit, unmanaged and unmonitored. This creates dangerous space debris that poses risks to active satellites and other missions. Such negligence is not a viable solution and only exacerbates the growing problem of orbital debris.

Currently, major satellite companies favor the second solution—graveyard orbit. To enable this, satellites are designed to retain enough propulsion energy at the end of their operational life to move into this designated orbit. While this is a step in the right direction, it remains far from ideal. As the amount of orbital debris continues to grow, it’s clear that new, more sustainable strategies are urgently needed.


This solution, as you might guess, is far from ideal. Currently, there isn't a single perfect or definitive answer to the problem of space debris, which continues to grow at an alarming rate. That’s why now is the time to focus on the innovative technologies and systems being developed to address this challenge in a more eco-friendly manner.

At the forefront of this effort are companies like Thales Alenia Space (TAS) and Airbus, pioneers in this field. They are among the first major players to conceptualize and test solutions in space, achieving notable success along the way. Let’s explore some of the most promising technologies under development.

One intriguing concept is the "space sweeper"—a satellite specifically designed to collect and remove space debris from orbit. Equipped with a robotic arm, it can capture debris and de-orbit it, reducing the risk of collisions with active satellites. Although still in its early stages, this technology offers significant promise for mitigating orbital debris in the future.

Another innovative idea is the "space net," a large deployable net designed to capture and remove debris from orbit. This concept is also in development and has the potential to become a cost-effective and efficient solution for cleaning up space.

Then there’s the concept of using destructive systems—essentially, space missiles designed to destroy non-functional satellites. While effective in eliminating satellites, this approach is far from eco-friendly. It’s currently being used by some companies, particularly newer entrants to the market that focus on launching low-cost satellites without considering their afterlife or environmental impact. From what i found, it's essentially chinese government and companies who do this kind of things. It's just speculation and personal opinion now, but i think it's also a way to display their power, and show how strong they are, to put a new menace to other government, as "we are more powerful than you, we can make space exploration a living hell and we can destroy all your satellite" more than a way to dispose of satellites.

Finally, there’s the "space harpoon" concept. This device would allow for the secure capture and removal of debris from orbit. Though still experimental, it shows considerable potential for space debris mitigation in the coming years.

In conclusion, the issue of space debris poses a significant challenge for the aerospace industry, necessitating the development of innovative technologies and systems to tackle it. Managing satellite waste effectively is a critical topic, as understanding how companies handle the full lifecycle of satellites is key to promoting sustainability. While no single solution exists yet, these promising technologies represent vital steps toward ensuring the long-term viability of space exploration and satellite operations.

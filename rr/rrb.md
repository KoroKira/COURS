**1. Introduction (Personal Connection)**

"Before we dive into today's topic, let me share a bit about myself. I'm currently a student at ICAM, but what really excites me is that I get to work at Thales Alenia Space in the aerospace industry. Now, I'll be honest - while it might sound glamorous to work with satellites, I'm actually just a fullstack developer. I'm more of a software guy than a rocket scientist!

But my fascination with space isn't new. Since childhood, my mind has been filled with stars, planets, and everything celestial. That's why when the opportunity came to work for a company at the forefront of space exploration, I jumped at it. Though I must admit - since this event is sponsored by Airbus, I wish I could say I worked for their Defense & Space division instead! Maybe after the next company merger, right?

All joking aside, I'm here today to talk about a crucial issue that keeps many of us in the industry awake at night: space debris and how companies manage the entire lifecycle of satellites.

This isn't just some niche technical concern - it's becoming one of the most pressing challenges of our era. As we send more objects into orbit, we're creating what could become humanity's most expensive garbage problem. And what's frightening is that we saw this coming decades ago..."


#### **2. The Growing Crisis: Space Congestion**

*"Let's examine the alarming reality of our crowded orbits. According to the latest ESA data, there are currently **39,230 human-made objects** being tracked in Earth's orbit. Yet only **11,100 of these are functioning satellites** - meaning over 70% of what we're tracking is essentially space junk.*

*The first warning signs appeared remarkably early in the Space Age. In **1961**, just four years after Sputnik's launch, some US scientists, published startlingly accurate predictions. Their research suggested the cataloged space population would grow by hundreds of objects annually. Today, with megaconstellations like Starlink, we're seeing this growth exceed **2,000 new objects per year** - far outpacing early projections.*

*To put this in perspective:

If we have to launch 25,000 satellites per year to maintain this pace, that's equivalent to launching **68 satellites every single day**. At this rate, we could replace every operational satellite in orbit in just **173 days**. What remains is essentially a growing cloud of space debris. And the consequences of this congestion are far from theoretical..."*

*This isn't just theoretical. The 1961 breakup of **Transit 4A** (also called 1961-Omicron) created over 300 trackable debris pieces - the first major accidental fragmentation in space history. It was a wake-up call about the dangers of orbital congestion.*

*NASA scientist Donald Kessler formalized these concerns in 1978 with his **Kessler Syndrome** theory - the nightmare scenario where collisions create more debris, causing more collisions in an unstoppable chain reaction. Tragically, we've already seen precursors to this with events like...*"

**3. The Inevitable End: How Satellites Meet Their Demise**  

*"Imagine a world where every car, phone, or computer was designed to fail within a few years—this is the harsh reality of our orbital infrastructure. Satellites don't die quietly; they perish in spectacular fashion, and their deaths have consequences for us all. The most common fate is a slow, fuel-starved demise. Like an aging athlete losing stamina, satellites gradually lose altitude when their station-keeping propellant runs dry, until Earth's gravity claims them. But not all get this 'graceful' exit. Some meet violent ends—shattered by hypervelocity impacts with space debris no larger than a paint chip, each collision spawning hundreds of new debris fragments in a terrifying chain reaction. Others succumb to the harsh space environment: solar flares fry their electronics, radiation corrupts their systems, or simply the march of technology renders them obsolete long before their hardware fails."*  

*"What's most troubling is the growing disparity in satellite longevity. On one end, Europe's meticulously crafted observatories like Meteosat operate flawlessly for 20+ years—precision instruments built to last. On the other, disposable megaconstellation satellites are designed for mere 5-year lifespans, with failure rates approaching 10% in their first year alone. This isn't just an engineering choice; it's creating an environmental crisis in low Earth orbit that will outlive us all. As we'll see next, how we handle these dead and dying satellites will determine whether space remains usable for future generations."*  

**4. Dealing with the Dead: Our Flawed Solutions for Space Junk**  

*"When satellites die, we face a cosmic recycling problem with no perfect solutions—only compromises. Currently, the space industry relies on three problematic approaches, each with hidden costs:*

**1. The Fiery Farewell (Atmospheric Burn-Up)**  
The most common method—pushing dead satellites to burn up in Earth's atmosphere—seems elegant until you examine the chemistry. Each reentry acts like a giant chemistry experiment, converting aluminum satellite bodies into **30kg of aluminum oxide nanoparticles per Starlink satellite**. With 120+ burning up monthly, we're creating a persistent metallic haze that **catalyzes ozone destruction** for decades. It's like solving a litter problem by setting trash on fire—out of sight, but with invisible atmospheric consequences.  

**2. The Orbital Cemetery (Graveyard Orbits)**  
For expensive GEO satellites, we opt for a 'space morgue'—pushing them 300km above operational orbits. But this isn't a solution; it's **intergenerational debt**. These graveyards already contain hundreds of zombie satellites that will haunt future spacefarers. The UK Space Agency estimates we'll exhaust usable graveyard space within **20-30 years**, turning these zones into minefields of uncontrolled mass.  

**3. The Cosmic Littering (Abandonment)**  
The worst option—doing nothing—remains shockingly common. Over **2,560 dead satellites** still occupy prime orbital real estate today. Like abandoned cars on a highway, they become **unguided projectiles**, with some (like Envisat) weighing as much as a school bus. The 2009 Iridium-Cosmos collision proved how even a single abandoned satellite can generate **2,300+ debris pieces** in an instant.  

*We're treating space like 19th-century rivers—using it as a dumping ground while pretending dilution equals solution. But as we'll see next, innovators are finally developing better tools for this cosmic cleanup..."*  

**5. The Future of Space Sustainability: From Concept to Reality**  

The space industry is finally waking up to its environmental responsibilities, developing innovative solutions that sound like science fiction but are quickly becoming operational reality. At the forefront of this movement are three complementary approaches that could fundamentally change how we manage orbital space.  

Active Debris Removal (ADR) technologies have progressed from theoretical concepts to tangible missions in just a few years. The European Space Agency's ClearSpace-1 mission, scheduled for 2026, represents a major milestone - the first commercial attempt to capture and deorbit a piece of existing debris using robotic arms. Meanwhile, Airbus has already demonstrated the viability of more unconventional approaches through its RemoveDEBRIS mission, which successfully tested both net capture and harpoon systems in actual orbital conditions. These technologies, while still in their infancy, could eventually lead to dedicated "space garbage trucks" that systematically clean up high-risk debris.  

On the prevention side, manufacturers like Thales Alenia Space are revolutionizing satellite design through their Zero Debris Platform initiative. This comprehensive approach rethinks materials, construction methods, and end-of-life planning to ensure satellites either completely burn up during reentry or can be efficiently removed from orbit. Their work on "demisable" components that vaporize predictably during atmospheric entry addresses one of the most persistent problems in space sustainability. Similarly, innovations like deployable drag sails - which can reduce deorbiting time from years to weeks - demonstrate how simple, low-cost solutions can have dramatic impacts.  

Perhaps most encouraging is the evolving regulatory landscape. The FCC's 2022 decision to reduce the maximum post-mission orbital lifetime from 25 years to just 5 represents the kind of policy shift needed to drive real change. When combined with initiatives like the Space Sustainability Rating system (which functions similarly to LEED certification for buildings) and the industry-wide Zero Debris Charter, we're seeing the emergence of a comprehensive framework for responsible space operations.  

These parallel developments in technology, design, and regulation suggest a future where space debris mitigation is baked into every phase of a satellite's lifecycle. While significant challenges remain, the pieces are falling into place for what could become one of humanity's most impressive environmental turnaround stories - proving that even in the harsh environment of space, sustainable practices are not just possible, but essential for preserving our orbital commons.

**6. Conclusion: Our Shared Responsibility for the Orbital Commons**  

As we've seen today, the space debris crisis presents one of the most complex environmental challenges of our era—one that demands immediate, coordinated action. While no single perfect solution exists yet, the combination of emerging technologies, sustainable design principles, and stronger regulations points toward a path forward.  

The fundamental truth is this: space is not an infinite dumping ground, but a fragile shared resource that belongs to all humanity. Every satellite operator—from government agencies to private startups—must embrace the principle that sustainability cannot be an afterthought. As the old aerospace saying goes, *"What goes up must come down responsibly."*  

Looking ahead, we face critical questions about how to balance innovation with preservation:  
- Should legacy space companies bear greater responsibility for cleaning up existing debris?  
- How can we incentivize startups to prioritize sustainability while remaining competitive?  
- What international frameworks are needed to enforce responsible behavior in orbit?  

The solutions will require unprecedented collaboration across borders and industries. But the alternative—a cascade of collisions that renders key orbits unusable—is simply unacceptable.  

As we open for questions, I'd particularly like to hear your thoughts: *In this new space race for sustainability, what role should established aerospace giants versus agile startups play? And how can we, as both professionals and citizens, contribute to solving this orbital environmental crisis?*  

The next chapter of space exploration must be written with sustainability as its guiding principle. Our actions today will determine whether Earth's orbits remain open for business—or become a no-fly zone of our own making.

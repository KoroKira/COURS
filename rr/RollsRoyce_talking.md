Before i begin to talk about anything, i need to explain some interesting things and some necessary things.
At first, let me tell you a little bit more about myself. Im a young student from ICAM, and since my childhood, i always had my thoughts filled about space, planets, stars and everything else. That's why, years later, to be more precise, now, i am currently working in the aerospace industry, to be more precise, at Thales Alenia Space. I know it could seems cool and incredible, but i am just a fullstack developper, nothing too fancy about satellites to be honest, because im more of a software guy. But, i have always been interested in the satellite and the stars, that's why when i had the opportunity to work for a company that is specialized in the aerospace industry, i took it. I know it's too bad: this event is sponsored by Airbus and it would have been cooler if i was from Defense & Space, but yeah, i guess maybe soon, if the company merging happen ahah.
But anyway, i should go back to the original topic ! If i am here, it's to talk about the satellite waste, and how does the company manage the whole lifecycle of a satellite. 

It's a very important subject in our times, because the space is getting more and more crowded, and the satellites are getting more and more numerous. There is some good companies who, since the early 2000, were already thinking about this future problems, and they have already started to work on it also. I have looked it, and found some trace of this concept, of "overcrowded space", to appear very early in the space race.

The earliest source of concern about "overcrowding space" can be traced back to 1961, just four years after the launch of Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite.
In 1961, E. E. Peterkin of the Operational Research Branch, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, published the first of two memoranda on satellite collisions. The first memorandum, titled "Some Characteristics of the Artificial Earth Satellite Population," predicted that the catalogued population of objects in space would grow by 318 objects per year.
It's worth noting that while Peterkin's work in 1961 marks the earliest formal recognition of this issue, the problem of space debris and overcrowding has since grown significantly, leading to more recent developments such as the Kessler syndrome proposed by NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler in 1978.
To put some datas in perspective, i'd like to ask you a quick question: how many satellite are there, above us ?

From SatelliteTracker3D, I found that there was about 25 000 satellites above us, debris and not debris. And from Orbit.ing.org, there is 11 884 Objects that are above us and active (INFORMATION A VERIFIER). So, with some quick math, there is about 13 116 satellites who are dead, but still above us, in space. That's a lot of satellites, but those numbers are difficult to understand, because they are way to big. So, let's imagine something... Let's imagine all of those satellites are up in space after a full year, like, from 0 to 25 000. It would mean that we would have to send a bit more than 68 satellites each day to space. It's massive. And in this parallel universe, where there is a bit more than 68 satellites sent everyday to space, it would mean that after 173 days, we will cease to send working satellites, and we will just be sending trash in space. 173 days, it's not even a year. It's not even a full year, and we would have already sent all of the satellites that are above us. It's a lot of satellites, and it's a lot of waste. And that's why, it's important to talk about the satellite waste, and how does the company manage the whole lifecycle of a satellite.
 
But before i begin, i would like to ask you a question: do you know how a satellite dies? I know it could seems like a weird question, but it's a very interesting one. So, let me explain to you how a satellite dies.

A satellite dies when it runs out of fuel, or when it is no longer able to maintain its orbit. This can happen for a number of reasons, including mechanical failure, damage from space debris, or simply reaching the end of its operational life. Usually, big companies are setting up some values to determine the end of the satellite life, and when it's time to retire it. From what i know, at TAS, we are at about 20-ish year before the quality of the satellite is not good enough for our quality standards, even if it would still be working and usable after. For other companies such as Starlink, it's... more sad. Their life expectancy is of 5 years. And during those 5 years, specialist have seen that the quality is, firstly, very cheap, and secondly, quickly decreasing. That's something that we have to keep in mind: the quality of the satellite is very important, and it's something that we have to keep in mind when we are talking about the satellite waste, and how does the company manage the whole lifecycle of a satellite, and that it's not all of the satellite company that are doing the same quality and life expectancy. 

This difference of life expectancy is easy to explain: we, in the old continent, are building some great master work, it's a work of art, personalized for each mission. Each satellite is unique, and is "handmade" at each step by the specialist. That's another thing important to keep in mind about the price also. The price is justified by the quality of the satellite. In the new continent, with all the new companies, in China, or in the USA, with Starlink especially, we can see that they are basically sending cheap space garbage, in great quantities, so that if it's not working, it's not a big deal, they have 1000 others. It's a very different way of thinking, and it's a very different way of working. It's more industrialized, bad and they try to seek to make it the cheapest way possible, without even thinking about the afterlife of the satellite.

When a satellite is judged as dead so, they need to be treated. There is 3 big ways currently for it: either they are sent back to earth to be destroyed by the entrance in the atmosphere, either they are sent to the "graveyard orbit", or either they are just... well, staying there. 

The first case is not that good for some reason, especially because it's putting some toxic heavy metals in the atmosphere, destroying the ozone layers. For the Starlink satellites, it have been found that currently, musk satellites are raining out of orbit at a rate of 120 per month and each one produce 30 kg of aluminium oxide which eat away at the ozone layer and these oxides have increased 8 folds in the atmosphere since 2016. Just this information is catastrophic, and it's just about Starlink satellites ! So if we are thinking of all of them... it's sure that satellite are dealing some heavy and unprecedented damage to the ozone layers.
For the second case, which is to be sent to the graveyard orbit, even if it seems like a good idea, it's not that good also. The graveyard orbit is a region of space that is far enough away from Earth that it is unlikely to interfere with active satellites or other space missions. However, it is not a permanent solution, as this orbit will be soon overcrowded and causing more damage than it's supposed to prevent. 
The third case, well, is bad because the satellite is not managed or anything, and it just become a dangerous space debris, staying here until something happen. It's not a good solution, and it's not a solution at all, because it's just doing nothing.

The big satellite companies, are currently targetting the second solution. So they are keeping some more propulsion energy in the satellite, so, when it's time, the satellite can be sent to the graveyard orbit.


This solution is not optimal as we can already guess. There is not a single good and optimal solution for now, and the problem of space debris is, and will be, always growing more and more. That's why i think it's now time to speak about the new technologies and system that are put in place to be more eco-friendly with all of our space waste. 

TAS and Airbus especially, are pioneering on this domain, as they are the first of the space giant to develop some concept solution, and trying them in space, with great success.
There is some new technologies that are currently being developed, and that are very promising. For example, there is the new concept of "space sweeper", which is a satellite that is designed to collect and remove space debris from orbit. This satellite is equipped with a robotic arm that can capture and de-orbit debris, reducing the risk of collisions with active satellites. This technology is still in the early stages of development, but it shows great promise for the future of space debris mitigation.
There is also some concept of "space net", which is a large net that can be deployed to capture and remove debris from orbit. This technology is also in the early stages of development, but it has the potential to be a cost-effective and efficient solution for cleaning up space debris.
Another concept, is simple: what if, we send something to just, destroy the satellite ? It's a very simple concept, but it's very effective. It's like a missile, but in space, and it's just to destroy the satellite. It's a very effective way to destroy the satellite, but it's not a very eco-friendly way to do it. But it's a solution, and it's a solution that is currently being used by some companies, especially the new ones, who are sending cheap satellites to space, and who are not thinking about the afterlife of the satellite.
Finally, there is the concept of "space harpoon", which is a device that can be used to capture and remove debris from orbit. This technology is still in the early stages of development, but it shows great promise for the future of space debris mitigation.

In conclusion, the problem of space debris is a growing concern for the aerospace industry, and it is important to develop new technologies and systems to mitigate this issue. The satellite waste is a very important subject, and it is important to understand how the company manage the whole lifecycle of a satellite. There is no single solution to this problem, but there are promising technologies that are being developed to address this issue. It is important to continue to research and develop new technologies to ensure the sustainability of space exploration and satellite operations.

I hope you have enjoyed my presentation, and that you have learned something new today. Thank you for your attention, and if you have any questions, i will be happy to answer them.

### REDACTION AMELIOREE


**Full Presentation Script: "Satellite Waste – Managing the Cosmic Lifecycle"**  
*(20-minute version for a mixed audience of experts and non-specialists)*  

---

**Opening (2 minutes):**  
"Good morning, everyone! My name is [Your Name], and I’d like to start with a confession: ever since I was a child, I’ve been obsessed with space. The stars, the planets, the sheer vastness of it all—it’s why I now work at Thales Alenia Space, even if my role there involves more coding than rocket science. Today, I want to talk about a topic that’s critical to the future of space exploration: **satellite waste**.  

You see, space isn’t just the 'final frontier'—it’s also becoming a cosmic junkyard. Right now, there are over **25,000 human-made objects** orbiting Earth. Only 40% of these are active satellites. The rest? Dead satellites, rocket parts, and fragments from collisions. If we don’t address this, we risk turning space into a minefield of debris, threatening everything from GPS to weather forecasts. Let’s explore how we got here—and what we’re doing about it."  

---

**Part 1: The Growing Problem of Space Debris (4 minutes):**  
"Imagine you’re driving on a highway. Now imagine that highway has no rules—no speed limits, no lanes, and everyone abandons their cars when they run out of gas. That’s essentially what’s happening in Earth’s orbit.  

The problem started small. In 1961, just four years after Sputnik, a U.S. Naval researcher named E.E. Peterkin predicted that space would become overcrowded. Fast-forward to 1978, when NASA scientist Donald Kessler warned that collisions could create a chain reaction, generating so much debris that certain orbits would become unusable. We call this the **Kessler Syndrome**.  

And it’s not just theory. In 2009, a defunct Russian satellite collided with an active American one at 26,000 mph. The impact created over **2,000 pieces of debris**, each capable of destroying another satellite. Today, the International Space Station regularly dodges debris. In 2022, it had to perform *32 emergency maneuvers* to avoid collisions.  

But why should this matter to *you*? Well, space debris doesn’t just threaten astronauts. It risks disrupting the satellites that power your smartphone’s GPS, streaming services, and even disaster response systems."  

---

**Part 2: The Life and Death of a Satellite (5 minutes):**  
"Let’s break down a satellite’s lifecycle. It begins with a **launch**—a fiery ride atop a rocket to its designated orbit. Once there, it might spend 5 to 20 years providing services like weather monitoring, telecommunications, or Earth observation.  

But how does a satellite *die*? There are three main killers:  
1. **Fuel starvation**: Satellites need fuel to maintain their orbit. Once it’s gone, they drift uncontrollably.  
2. **Radiation damage**: Space is harsh. Over time, radiation fries electronics.  
3. **Obsolescence**: Technology evolves fast. A satellite designed in 2010 might be useless by 2030.  

Now, here’s where things get interesting. Not all satellites are built the same. Companies like Airbus or Thales design **high-end satellites**—custom-built, rigorously tested, and meant to last 15–20 years. They’re like luxury cars: expensive but durable.  

On the flip side, companies launching **mega-constellations**—like Starlink—take a different approach. Their satellites are mass-produced, cheaper, and replaced every 5–7 years. Think of them as bicycles: not built to last, but easy to replace. This approach has democratized internet access globally, but it’s also flooding orbit with short-lived hardware."  

---

**Part 3: End-of-Life Management – The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (5 minutes):**  
"So, what happens when a satellite dies? There are three options—but none are perfect.  

**Option 1: Controlled Reentry**. Guide the satellite to burn up in Earth’s atmosphere. Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, recent studies reveal a catch. When satellites like Starlink’s reenter, they release **aluminum oxide particles**. A single Starlink satellite sheds about 30 kg of this material. Multiply that by 120 satellites reentering *every month*, and you get an **eightfold increase** in atmospheric aluminum since 2016. Why does this matter? Aluminum oxide erodes the ozone layer—the same layer we’ve worked so hard to repair since banning CFCs.  

**Option 2: The Graveyard Orbit**. For satellites in geostationary orbit (GEO), we boost them 300 km higher into a 'retirement home'. But this isn’t a solution—it’s a delay tactic. These satellites will haunt that orbit for centuries.  

**Option 3: Do Nothing**. Abandon the satellite. Today, over **36,000 pieces of debris** larger than 10 cm are zipping around Earth. Even a 1 cm fragment can hit with the force of a hand grenade. In 2021, a debris strike punched a hole in the International Space Station’s robotic arm. Imagine that hitting a crewed module."  

---

**Part 4: Innovating for a Sustainable Future (3 minutes):**  
"Now for the good news: engineers and policymakers are rising to the challenge. Let’s look at three groundbreaking solutions.  

**First: Active Debris Removal (ADR)**. Imagine a cosmic garbage truck. The European Space Agency’s **ClearSpace-1 mission**, launching in 2026, will do just that. Equipped with robotic arms, it’ll capture debris and drag it into the atmosphere to burn up. Other ideas? Lasers to nudge debris into lower orbits, or harpoons to spear and retrieve it.  

**Second: Design for Demise**. Instead of aluminum, companies are testing materials that fully vaporize during reentry. The ESA’s **EcoDesign Initiative** now mandates sustainability in satellite design. At Thales, we’re prototyping alloys that disappear like sugar in hot tea.  

**Third: On-Orbit Servicing**. Why trash a satellite when you can fix it? Northrop Grumman’s **Mission Extension Vehicle** docks with aging satellites to refuel or repair them. It’s like a AAA service call—but in zero gravity!"  

---

**Closing (1 minute):**  
"Space is a **shared resource**, much like our oceans or atmosphere. But today, only 60% of satellites follow international guidelines to deorbit within 25 years. We need global standards—agreements that balance innovation with responsibility.  

The choices we make today will determine whether future generations inherit a usable orbital environment or a wasteland of debris. As someone who’s dreamed of space since childhood, I’m optimistic. With collaboration, creativity, and a commitment to sustainability, we can keep the stars within reach.  

Thank you—and I’d love to hear your thoughts or questions!"

### **Title: Space Trash: How We’re Cluttering the Final Frontier (and What We Can Do About It)**

---

### **1. Introduction: From Starry-Eyed Kid to Satellite Developer** 

Hello everyone, my name is Guilhem Desarcy-Lemiere, and I’m thrilled to be here today to talk about a topic that’s near and dear to my heart: **satellite waste**. But first, let me share a bit about myself, and the reason of this subject. So i'm currently in an apprenticeship at Thales Alenia Space, at Toulouse, as a fullstack developper. I'm - sadly - not working directly on the satellite, i'm more on the "worker" part of the enterprise, developping solutions for the company's worker to help them everyday to do their work. And working on this kind of enterprise was a childhood dream, because i've always been fascinated by the stars, the planets, and everything else. So, when i had the opportunity to work for a company that is specialized in the aerospace industry, i took it. And now, i'm here, talking to you about the satellite waste, and how does the company manage the whole lifecycle of a satellite. What's a life ahah !

To be more serious, the reason of this subject is because the space is getting more and more crowded, the satellites are multiplying like rabbits, and... we're running out of space. Literally. So, let's talk about it.

*Joke:* "Why did the satellite go to therapy? It had low orbit self-esteem!"
---

### **2. The Problem: Space is a Crowded Parking Lot**  

So let's trace back the history a little bit, because this problem isn't something recent, it's something that was predicted even before the industrialization of the satellite as we know. In fact, it was in 1961, that E. E. Peterkin, a U.S. Naval Research Laboratory researcher, predicted that the catalogued population of objects in space would grow by 318 objects per year. This was the earliest source i could find about satellite waste, and trust me, i tried to look at earlier one's. But it's not the only one of course, as in 1978, NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler, warned that collisions could create a chain reaction, generating so much debris that certain orbits would become unusable. We call this the **Kessler Syndrome**. To put some kind of analogy here, let's imagine that space is full of cosmic bumper cars, creating endless debris. It's a very good analogy, because it's exactly what's happening. One is hitting another, creating some debris, and those debris are hitting another, creating more debris, and so on.

And this syndrome isn't just some kind of theory, as it happened: in 2009, a defunct Russian satellite collided with an active American one, at the whooping speed of 26,000 mph, or 41,843 km/h in some real measurement units. This impact created over **2,000 pieces of debris**, each capable of destroying another satellite. The size of them were from 10 cm to 1 cm, and even a 1 cm fragment can hit with the force of a hand grenade. Those debris where so dangerous that the International Space Station had to perform **32 emergency maneuvers** to avoid collisions. Usually, they have to perform 2 or 3 per year, but this time, it was 32. 

And there is, of course, a cost behind those maneuvers, and it's not a small one. It's about 600 000 dollars per maneuver, and it's not a small amount of money. But it's not just about the money, it's about the risk that those debris are posing to the astronauts, and to the station. 

Sadly, it's not always possible to predict and to avoid all those debris in space, as we can remember, in 2021, that a debris strike punched a hole in the International Space Station’s robotic arm. Imagine that hitting a crewed module. So, it's not just a theory, it's a real problem, and it's a problem that we have to address, and that we have to solve. 

But why should this matter to *you*? Well, space debris doesn’t just threaten astronauts. It risks disrupting the satellites that power your smartphone’s GPS, streaming services, and even disaster response systems. 

Before continuing, i would like to ask you a question: how many satellite are there, above us ? Think of a number, is that 1,000 ? Nah, not enough. Is that 10,000 ? Not enough also. It's actually 25,000.

In today's reality, there is about 25,000 objects in orbit: 11,884 of them are active, while 13,116 are dead satellites or debris.

I know that the human brain cannot process this kind of big datas, it's kinda impossible for us to visualize it. So let's imagine, an alternate reality: humanity is working in team, there is no Big Bad Evil Guy, everyone is friendly and so on. The 1st of January 2025 mark the date that space is now accessible to us: we can send satellites, humans or anything there. If in this reality, in 2026 they would have hitted the 25 000 satellites, it would mean that they had to achieve some kind of amazing performance: they would have to send 68 satellites each day to space. And to put it into perspective, after 173 days, they would have already sent all of the working satellites that are above us. So after 173 days, we'd just be launching trash... Happy Earth Day! Bravo the ecologist ahah.

  - *Dark humor:* "After 173 days, we’d just be launching trash. Happy Earth Day!"  


### **3. How Satellites Die (and Why It Matters)**  

Let’s break down a satellite’s lifecycle. It begins with a **launch**—a fiery ride atop a rocket to its designated orbit. Once there, it might spend 5 to 20 years providing services like weather monitoring, telecommunications, or Earth observation. And we could just have summed up the life of a satellite in one sentence: it's born, it's working, and it's dying. But it's not that simple, because there is a lot of things that are happening during those 5 to 20 years.

I'd like at first, to talk about the current industry, because, as someone who work directly in this, i think it's vital to talk about it. There is 3 majors pole in the satellite industry: the European one, the American one, and the Chinese one. And each of them have their own way of working, and their own way of thinking. In Europe, we are still doing satellite the old fashionned way: it's handcrafted by master in their domain, each piece is unique, done only for this satellite and this mission. It's like a work of art, personalized for each mission... We can say it's handcrafted "Rolls-Royce" satellites.
While in USA - and China by extension - they are doing it in a very different way. They are mass-producing satellites, they are sending them in great quantities, and they are not thinking about the afterlife of the satellite. It's more industrialized, bad and they try to seek to make it the cheapest way possible, without even thinking about the afterlife of the satellite. It's like they are sending cheap space garbage, in great quantities, so that if it's not working, it's not a big deal, they have 1000 others. It's a very different way of thinking, and it's a very different way of working. It's more industrialized, bad and they try to seek to make it the cheapest way possible, without even thinking about the afterlife of the satellite.

Sadly, the spatial industry is more rewarding the industry way, more than the qualified and more handcraft way. That's why European constructor, such as Thales Alenia Space, and Airbus, are trying to move to a new way of working, with constellations and more a mass production, with adaptable satellites that can easily do the work for diverse missions.

We can summup as something like... Europe builds Ferraris; other print disposable satellites on Wish.com.



### **4. The Afterlife of Satellites: 3 Terrible Options**  

Now that we have talked about the life of a satellite, let's talk a bit more about their death !

Of course, satellite can dies from a lot of way. It can go to fuel depletion, mechanical failure, electronic failure, solar flares, spatial radiations, space debris hits, and way more. But the most common way for a satellite to die is the fuel depletion. Satellites need fuel to maintain their orbit. Once it’s gone, they drift uncontrollably. For example, in 2019, the European Space Agency's Aeolus satellite, which was launched in 2018, was about to run out of fuel. The satellite was designed to last 3 years, but it was still working after 3 years, and it was still working after 4 years. But it was about to run out of fuel, and it was about to die. So, the ESA had to perform a maneuver to deorbit the satellite, and to avoid any collision with other satellite. It was a very dangerous maneuver, because the satellite was still working, and it was still sending datas. But it was a necessary maneuver, because if they didn't do it, the satellite would have died, and it would have become a dangerous space debris.

There is 3 main way to manage the natural death of a satellite: either they are burned while being sent to atmosphere, either they are sent to the Graveyard orbit, and either they are just... abandonned in place.

In the first case, even if it seems to be a great solution, quick and easy, it reveal to be maybe one of the worse for the earth atmosphere. It's to just, send back the satellite to the earth, and when it will begin to enter our atmosphere, with the speed, the friction will make it burn, and it will disappear, in a tiny powder, so tiny that no one could ever see it with the naked eye. The problem here, is invisible: when burning, it releases some devastating ozone eating aluminum oxide. For example, it have been found that currently, musk satellites are raining out of orbit at a rate of 120 per month and each one produce 30 kg of aluminium oxide which eat away at the ozone layer and these oxides have increased 8 folds in the atmosphere since 2016. Just this information is catastrophic, and it's just about Starlink satellites ! So if we are thinking of all of them... it's sure that satellite are dealing some heavy and unprecedented damage to the ozone layers. By the way, quick fun fact: there is not enough Starlink satellites that are sent back to space to compensate their actual raining rate.

Anyway, it's not a good solution, and it's not a solution at all, because it's just doing nothing. It's just sending back the satellite to the earth, and it's just creating some more problems. So let's take a look at the second solution. The graveyard orbit is a region of space that is far enough away from Earth that it is unlikely to interfere with active satellites or other space missions. However, it is not a permanent solution, as this orbit will be soon overcrowded and causing more damage than it's supposed to prevent. It's a temporary fix, and it's not a solution at all. It's just delaying the problem, and it's just creating more problems. 

The third solution is the worst of all. It's to just abandon the satellite. Today, over **36,000 pieces of debris** larger than 10 cm are zipping around Earth. this is a disaster.

1. **Burn in the atmosphere:**  
   - **Problem:** Releases ozone-eating aluminum oxide (e.g., Starlink: 120 satellites/month = 30kg/satellite → 8x ozone damage since 2016).  
   - *Joke:* "Musk’s satellites: great for internet, bad for breathing."  
2. **Graveyard orbit:**  
   - Temporary fix. Soon, it’ll be a cosmic junkyard.  
3. **Abandon in place:**  
   - Creates zombie satellites—space debris haunting future missions.

### **5. Solutions: From Sci-Fi Dreams to Reality**  
- **Active debris removal:**  
  - **Space sweepers:** Robotic janitors with claws/nets (TAS/Airbus prototypes).  
  - **Space harpoons:** "Fishing for trash" in orbit (early testing).  
- **Controversial fixes:**  
  - Anti-satellite missiles: "Effective? Yes. Eco-friendly? Hard no."  
- **The future:**  
  - Reusable satellites, stricter regulations, global collaboration.

### **6. Conclusion: Don’t Let Space Become a Landfill**  
- **Key takeaway:**  
  - We need sustainable satellite design AND cleanup tech.  
  - *Call to action:* "If we can put humans on the Moon, we can clean up our mess."  
- **Final joke:** "Next time you binge Netflix via satellite… thank a space janitor!"

### **Why This Structure Works:**  
1. **Engaging flow:** Starts personal → builds urgency → explains problems → offers solutions.  
2. **Humor:** Makes technical topics relatable without undermining seriousness.  
3. **Contrasts:** TAS vs. Starlink, old vs. new space, problem vs. solution.  
4. **Memorable analogies:** "Space junk food," "cosmic junkyard," "zombie satellites."

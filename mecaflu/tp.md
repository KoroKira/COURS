The pressure at which water is emitted from a Kärcher-type pressure washer depends on the specific model and its intended use. Here are some examples:

- **Domestic Pressure Washers**: These typically operate at pressures ranging from **20 to 160 bar (2 to 16 MPa)**, as seen in models like the Kärcher K7. They are suitable for general household cleaning tasks such as washing cars, patios, and furniture.

- **Professional Cold-Water Pressure Washers**: These can reach pressures of **up to 150 bar** with high water flow rates, designed for heavy-duty cleaning tasks in professional settings.

- **Professional Hot-Water Pressure Washers**: These machines can operate at pressures of **up to 200 bar**, making them ideal for removing stubborn dirt in industrial or agricultural environments.

The pressure can often be adjusted depending on the cleaning task, with some models featuring controls on the spray lance or trigger gun.

## The Growing Problem of Space Debris
- Mankind has sent thousands of satellites into orbit around the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) since the beginning of space exploration, with satellites being crucial in daily lives, but each launch also jettisons debris into orbit [(00:00:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=27s).
- The accumulation of waste in space has become a significant problem, with the situation close to running out of control, and the generation of debris happening faster than it can be cleaned out by the atmosphere [(00:00:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=52s).
- The debris poses a danger to all other satellites and future space missions, with nearly a million objects larger than half an inch having been counted, and being struck by orbital debris is a constant threat for all satellites [(00:03:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=204s).
- Satellites undertake precise missions, such as photographing the Earth, establishing weather forecasts, relaying signals, and spying on other countries, but they can break down or stop working when they run out of power, becoming orbital debris [(00:02:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=147s).

## The Origins of Space Debris
- The problem of orbital debris began 60 years ago, at the end of the 1950s, when the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) launched [Sputnik 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1), the world's first satellite, which stopped working after 21 days and became a non-functioning artificial object, or orbital debris [(00:04:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=271s).
- The launch of Sputnik triggered the space race, with the Americans creating [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) to catch up with the Soviets, and the Soviets launching spy satellites fueled by nuclear reactors, some of which were defective and posed a risk to the environment [(00:05:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=324s).
- One such incident occurred in 1977, when the [Russian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language) satellite [Kosmos 954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954), fueled by a nuclear reactor, was lost, and scattered radioactive material all over [Northern Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Canada) when it re-entered the atmosphere [(00:06:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=391s).
- The incident highlighted the risks of orbital debris and the need for space cleanup, with rocket scientist Christoph Bernal noting that the problem started at the same time as the first launch of Sputnik on October 4th, 1957 [(00:04:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=260s).

## The Dangers of Space Debris
- Space debris poses a potential danger to the population on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), and it is not the only danger, as launching satellites into orbit also creates debris, with each rocket launch leaving debris in orbit [(00:08:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=490s).
- The situation of space debris has led to the current state, where old satellites have stayed in orbit, and the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) engineer Radica Yin has analyzed the orbital debris created by rocket launches, which includes the upper stages of a rocket, fuel tanks, and other objects that are systematically left in orbit [(00:08:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=539s).
- Over the last 60 years, much of the debris has accumulated, while some has disintegrated, and space scientists like Noelia Sanchez Ortiz analyze the circumstances and destiny of orbital debris, which can remain in orbit unless it is very low and slowly falls down into the Earth [(00:09:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=564s).
- Debris at low altitude moves at speeds of 18,000 miles an hour, but the Earth's atmosphere gradually slows it down, and when pieces eventually fall to Earth, they are mostly destroyed, with the air molecules being compressed by the speed, creating heat and eventually combustion, causing the pieces to break up [(00:09:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=591s).
- Problems arise when debris does not burn up completely in the atmosphere, and there have been instances where debris has crashed into the Earth, such as the 550-pound fuel tank of a [Delta II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_II) rocket that crashed near [Georgetown, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown,_Texas) in [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas) in 1997 [(00:10:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=637s).
- Orbital debris poses a threat to the Earth's population, and it is now cataloged and the risk evaluated, with over 20,000 objects tracked, and while most of them remain in orbit, a minor portion comes down to the Earth and re-enters [(00:11:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=696s).
- The mass of all satellites and debris in orbit represents a mass of 7,500 tons, which is equivalent to the mass of the [Eiffel Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower), and while it may seem like a significant amount, it is spread out in a vast area, making it more like a cloud of dust [(00:12:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=737s).

## Satellite Orbits and Debris Accumulation
- Satellites around the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) use three different orbits, with the furthest being the geostationary orbit, a thin layer 22,000 miles away, where satellites remain constantly above the same point on the equator, providing telecommunications, telephone, and computer link-ups, and television broadcasts [(00:13:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=791s).
- Satellites need to be removed when they have served their time, and their last fuel reserves are used to de-orbit them to another area, such as a graveyard orbit, where they will not interfere with anything below geostationary orbit [(00:13:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=837s).
- Medium Earth orbit is situated between 22,000 and 1,200 miles in altitude, and is occupied by radio navigation satellites like GPS, which are placed into an intermediate orbit if they break down to avoid interference with other satellites [(00:14:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=864s).
- [Low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit), situated below 1,200 miles in altitude, is where the last 60 years of space exploration has left the most debris, and the only way to get rid of debris in this area is to send it into Earth's atmosphere where it disintegrates [(00:14:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=891s).
- There are areas on Earth, such as the South Pacific, where objects can re-enter with almost no risk due to their distance from populations, and large objects are often re-entered in these areas [(00:15:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=923s).

## Causes of Satellite Malfunctions and Debris Generation
- Satellites can be controlled and moved out of the way if they still have fuel, but some satellites can still malfunction and become out of control, even if they have fuel, and the cause of these malfunctions is often unknown [(00:15:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=943s).
- Solar flares can cause malfunctions in satellites by releasing huge amounts of energy and electrically charged particles into space, which can wipe out navigation systems and turn satellites into orbital debris [(00:16:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1004s).
- Space is an infinite empty space with some junk and debris moving about, posing two significant problems: objects can stay in orbit for a long time, and they are moving at high speeds, increasing the probability of crashing into something [(00:17:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1068s).
- The situation with space debris has degenerated since 2007, with two significant events, including the collision between [Kosmos 2251](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_2251), a [Russian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language) satellite, and [Iridium 33](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_33), an [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) satellite, which sent deadly fragments flying in all directions and posed a threat to devices in **low** **Earth** **orbit** [(00:18:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1107s).
- Another event that contributed to the increase in space debris was when [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) deliberately destroyed a weather satellite, which added to the already significant amount of junk in space [(00:19:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1190s).
- The [Chinese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language) authorities demonstrated their strength by using a ballistic missile armed with an infrared seeker and a warhead, which was an arrogant show of strength with no concern for the consequences [(00:20:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1216s).
- As a result of this event and another, by 2010, there were more than 17,000 large pieces of debris circling the earth, including pieces from satellites and rockets, with some of the debris coming from the fuel tank of a normal rocket [(00:20:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1240s).

## Kessler Syndrome and the Cascading Effect of Collisions
- The fuel tank of a rocket contains liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, which can mix and explode, creating a thousand pieces of debris that remain in orbit, and this phenomenon is known as [Donald J. Kessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler) syndrome, named after the [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) consultant who described and quantified it [(00:21:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1267s).
- Don Kessler proposed the scenario of [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome) back in 1978, predicting that collisions would have a cascading effect, increasing the likelihood of further collisions, and this theory was proven accurate in 1996 when debris from an [Ariane (rocket family)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_(rocket_family)) rocket knocked out a French military satellite [(00:22:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1326s).
- The proliferation of debris risks compromising today's constantly diversifying satellite services, which are a major part of our daily lives, including telecommunications, banking, and GPS systems, and space agencies have to take serious risks each time they launch [(00:24:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1498s).
- The issue of space debris is a serious concern, as it can damage spacecraft and produce a spray of particles that can travel fast and cause further damage, and the cascading effect of collisions can lead to a slow but steady increase in the amount of debris in orbit [(00:22:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1375s).
- The problem of space debris is likened to a pandemic, as it proliferates and risks creating even more debris, and it is expected that every 10 years, two objects will collide and create a major breakup, and every five years, collisions between large objects and fragments will produce more debris [(00:21:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1287s).
- Launching satellites despite the possibility of conjunctions with objects is a risk that has been proven and quantified, with the odds of losing a satellite being around five percent, partly due to the risk of being hit by debris [(00:25:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1546s).
- The likelihood of losing a satellite can quickly reach 10 or 20 percent with the increase in orbital debris, and the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) estimates that the risk of collision will rise to 20 percent by 2038 [(00:26:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1576s).

## Space Surveillance and Collision Avoidance
- Space agencies have had to look at ways of negotiating this problem and detecting the circling waste, with the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) using a space surveillance network since 1957 to predict where and when orbital debris will enter the Earth's atmosphere [(00:26:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1601s).
- The system has been refined and computerized over time, and it uses a catalog of debris to determine which country owns the debris that is entering the atmosphere and to warn [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) if debris is at risk of interfering with their satellites [(00:26:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1614s).
- In [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), a similar space surveillance system was not put in place until 40 years later, in 1996, when debris from the [Ariane (rocket family)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_(rocket_family)) rocket damaged the military satellite [Cerise (satellite)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerise_(satellite)), and the French Ministry of Defense created a system known as [Grave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave) [(00:27:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1657s).
- The Grave system uses a particular radar to make real-time calculations and follow the trajectories of thousands of satellites, and it was able to detect 30 or so [Chinese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language) and American spy satellites that had not been cataloged previously [(00:28:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1685s).
- International relations in space are a mixture of mutual aid and competition, and [France](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) agreed to keep quiet about the spy satellites in return for access to the American orbital debris catalog, which is more detailed than the European version [(00:28:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1734s).
- The constant space surveillance is efficient and allows civilian and military satellites to avoid collisions with orbital debris, and ground-based operators can move their satellites slightly out of their orbit if there is a risk [(00:29:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1766s).
- The [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) is threatened by debris several times a year and has to be moved from its course to avoid orbital debris with an identified trajectory, and this constant threat has become part of the astronauts' daily lives [(00:30:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1836s).
- The International Space Station (ISS) has to take evasive action when debris is detected, which involves turning on the engines for 37 seconds to move into a higher orbit, and this is the only time when acceleration can be felt on board, making the astronauts no longer weightless as they are pushed backwards by the engines [(00:31:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1884s).
- If the ballistic data about debris is imprecise, no risks are taken, and the astronauts are told to evacuate the station urgently, taking refuge in the Escape module, which can be separated from the station and return the astronauts to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) [(00:32:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1928s).
- Evacuation is not necessary every time, as frequently, orbital debris is not detected if it is smaller than four inches, and nowadays, there are millions of pieces of junk that are too small to be followed by radars [(00:32:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1963s).

## Protecting Spacecraft from Debris Impacts
- To avoid the menace of space debris, satellites and the space station need to be protected, and scientists from the [Fraunhofer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_Society) in [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) are testing shielding materials using a super-fast accelerator known as a space gun [(00:33:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=1985s).
- The space gun fires tiny metal balls at various shielding materials to reproduce conditions in space, and the behavior of collisions at hypervelocity speeds is very different from that on Earth, with a one millimeter ball having more energy than a baseball flying at 60 miles an hour [(00:33:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2014s).
- The results of these tests on different satellite components are analyzed, and the scientists have been able to design satellites that are resistant to small debris, but even today, astronauts remain exposed to small debris when they are outside their vehicles during spacewalks [(00:35:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2125s).
- [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) is actively developing robots that could replace humans to accomplish maintenance operations outside the spacecraft, as even a minor impact from small debris could puncture an astronaut's suit and lead to instant death, and robots would also be unable to withstand a collision with debris of more than half an inch [(00:37:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2229s).

## Mitigation Efforts and International Cooperation
- Cultures around the world have tried to establish rules for the non-proliferation of large debris, such as emptying fuel on board space vehicles and venting or burning excess fuel, with satellites limited to a maximum 25-year lifespan in orbit [(00:37:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2261s).
- Objects in **low** **earth** **orbit** that do not completely burn up on re-entry are steered towards broad ocean areas for their final impact, but these rules are not always respected due to the lack of a governing body to police offenders [(00:38:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2296s).
- The amount of junk in space increases over time, generating debris faster than it can be cleaned out by the atmosphere, creating an unsustainable environment [(00:38:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2320s).
- The only real solution to this problem is to clean out the debris that is orbiting around the earth, which involves bringing back some of the objects that have been left in orbit, with each country supposed to finance the elimination of its own debris based on the polluter pays principle [(00:39:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2340s).

## Developing Solutions for Space Debris Removal
- Space Engineers have been creating a new profession, the "space garbage guy", to come up with robotic systems that can deal with large pieces of garbage by sending them into the Earth's atmosphere [(00:39:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2361s).
- Laboratories around the world, such as the Surrey Space Center in England, have been working on robot satellites that can capture debris and deorbit it, with projects like the Remove Debris project [(00:40:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2400s).
- One of the technologies being developed is the harpoon, which is designed to attach onto a piece of debris and drag it into the atmosphere, with the team currently testing a miniature harpoon on a stationary target [(00:40:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2426s).
- Another solution being developed is the [Medusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa) satellite, created by the [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa) space agency, which can unfold its tentacles to capture debris and drag it to where it needs to be, either to a [Grave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave) orbit or to decrease its altitude and let it burn up in the atmosphere [(00:42:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2524s).
- The development of these solutions is a long process, with the first full-scale tests in space scheduled to take place in 2020, and the team is improving its system through a trial and error method [(00:41:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2514s).
- Satellites can be launched directly from the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station), and a device called Medusa, which weighs about 175 grams, is designed to be put onto cubesats, small multi-use satellites in the shape of a four-inch cube, to eliminate debris over a 25-year period [(00:42:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2566s).
- Medusa allows for multiple attempts to remove small targets, but it only targets small space junk, and other tools are necessary for large non-functioning satellites, which opens up the problem of financing these operations [(00:43:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2627s).
- The largest non-operational piece of space debris is [Envisat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envisat), an observation satellite the size of a bus launched by the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) in 2002, which was supposed to be deorbited after five years but is now a ticking time bomb as it crosses paths with many other working satellites [(00:44:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2671s).
- The European Space Agency is funding an ambitious program to try and remove Envisat from its orbit, and one option being considered is throwing a net to capture the satellite, which would be pulled by a tether [(00:46:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2765s).
- To test this space net, engineers use an aircraft to recreate space's zero gravity conditions, and tests have shown that adding weight to the corners of the net allows it to enclose the body of a satellite without snagging on its fragile solar panels [(00:46:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2789s).
- The project to remove Envisat is still in the theoretical stages due to the high cost, estimated at half a billion euros, and no robot garbage collector is ready for work at this time [(00:47:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2865s).

## Space Tugs and Autonomous Technologies
- The cleanup operation for space debris would need to be free, similar to a passenger on another mission, and one promising solution is the use of space tugs, which are multifunctional and can perform various tasks such as refilling, repairing, and inspecting satellites, as well as gathering space junk and sending it into the atmosphere [(00:48:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2891s).
- Space tugs are being developed by Airbus Engineers, but technological problems remain, including the inability to perform a scheduled rendezvous with a target that has not been designed for this purpose, such as an old satellite or piece of orbital debris [(00:48:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2932s).
- To overcome this, new autonomous technologies need to be developed, based on vision sensors that can scan the environment, analyze images, and detect and manipulate objects, allowing space tugs to manage on their own [(00:49:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2955s).
- The Space Tag project is still being studied, but thanks to major funding, the first efficient cleaning service may come into use by 2025, and other ambitious startups, such as [Eutelsat OneWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutelsat_OneWeb), are also working on launching thousands of satellites into **low** **Earth** **orbit** to create a network for broadband internet [(00:49:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=2981s).

## Mega Constellations and the Need for Regulation
- The launch of [Satellite internet constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_internet_constellation), such as OneWeb's, which will have 882 satellites, is a source of concern for orbital debris specialists, as it will significantly increase the amount of space debris, and there are many other Mega constellations being proposed, including those by [Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing) and [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX) [(00:51:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3062s).
- The promoters of these projects maintain that they have taken necessary precautions, but there is a need for a regulatory environment to ensure that deorbiting and operations are done in a manner consistent with long-term use of space for humanity [(00:51:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3105s).
- There is a danger that space will be filled with even more garbage if there are failures, and satellites break down, and international regulations are urgently required to avoid an orbital debris pandemic [(00:52:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3120s).
- Most people engaged in space exploration are advocating for regulations, but there is currently no global body that regulates space debris, and it is a concern that different groups are thinking about regulating it in different ways [(00:52:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3153s).
- Countries have varying thoughts about regulation, but a concrete solution is needed to address the issue of space debris, which could potentially come from the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) through legislation [(00:52:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3168s).
- The United Nations may need to force countries to get involved in cleaning up space debris, as the problem is a major concern for satellite operators, and the "polluter pays" rule has not yet been applied [(00:52:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3176s).
- The issue of orbital debris is a significant problem that could have severe consequences, and although it is not widely known, it has the potential to impact people's lives in the future [(00:53:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps11rF5AnRg&t=3189s).

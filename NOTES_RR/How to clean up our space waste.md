## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=0s)
- Space is used daily, with thousands of satellites supporting modern life, including TV signals, phone calls, [Google Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Maps), [Global Positioning System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System), the internet, bank transactions, and more, to keep lives running smoothly [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=0s)
- These satellites facilitate various essential services, such as disaster planning, military surveillance, air traffic control, weather prediction, crop farming, and providing data on the oceans, outer space, and global warming [(00:00:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=8s)
- The increasing number of satellites in space has led to a significant amount of space junk, posing an explosive threat, as the focus was on setting up satellites without considering future sustainability [(00:00:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=12s)
- The problem of space junk has become a major concern, with the need to determine the amount of junk in orbit and find a way to clean it up [(00:00:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=38s)
- The satellites provide crucial services, including Google Maps, GPS, and the internet, and also support the stock market, disaster planning, and military surveillance, highlighting the importance of addressing the space junk issue [(00:00:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=21s)

## Why space junk is dangerous [(00:00:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=54s)
- The [Space environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment) is not as empty as it is often perceived, with lower [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) orbit being more crowded than ever, having broken records for space launches in 2022 with over 2,000 spacecraft going into orbit [(00:00:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=54s).
- In addition to functioning spacecraft, there are thousands of dead and broken satellites, old rocket parts, and other man-made [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) flying around Earth at high speeds, posing a significant threat of collisions [(00:00:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=58s).
- The threat of collisions is a major problem due to the high speeds of orbiting objects, which can reach up to 28,000 kilometers per hour, and even a small screw colliding with a spacecraft can have a devastating impact [(00:01:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=79s).
- Space debris can collide, explode, and break into thousands of tiny pieces, making it difficult to remove once it becomes small [(00:01:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=86s).
- The issue of space debris has been accumulating since the 1950s, with no plan or system in place for cleaning up satellites and other objects launched into space [(00:01:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=102s).
- With over 90 countries operating in space and an estimated 17,000 new satellites set to be launched by 2030, the problem of space debris is expected to worsen, potentially creating a "super junk space highway" and making some areas of Earth's orbit unusable for future generations [(00:01:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=117s).
- The pollution of space with waste is a significant environmental concern, similar to the pollution of other environments, such as the ocean, and it is essential to address this issue to prevent long-term damage [(00:02:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=129s).

## Ingenious solutions [(00:02:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=155s)
- Big tech players are working to make the space race more sustainable, with former [Apple Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.) co-founder [Steve Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak) heading a company called [Privateer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privateer) that tracks over 27,000 larger pieces of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) in real time to prevent explosive collisions [(00:02:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=157s).
- Privateer's competition, [LeoLabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeoLabs), provides a similar debris tracking service and sends out more than 400 million collision alerts to satellites every month, but tracking smaller pieces of space junk is not possible and maneuvering satellites to avoid collisions is costly [(00:02:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=173s).
- The cost of avoiding collisions is not only financial, as it also results in a loss of scientific data, with space debris analyst Jan Siminski noting that switching off an instrument on board to perform an avoidance maneuver means a huge amount of data is lost [(00:03:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=199s).
- Reducing the number of satellite launches is not a quick fix, as every collision in lower [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) orbit generates a new cloud of debris, causing more collisions and potentially leading to the Kessler syndrome, a cascading ricochet effect [(00:03:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=220s).
- Imogen Nappa and her team at [University of Portsmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Portsmouth) are advocating for an orbital trustee, where nations and industries using Earth's orbit would work together to decide how to use the area sustainably, drawing comparisons between space debris and plastic trash in the ocean [(00:03:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=238s).
- The establishment of an orbital trustee is seen as a necessary step to prevent further damage to Earth's orbit, with the success of the High Seas treaty taking 20 years to come to an agreement, and now requiring quick action to address the issue of space debris [(00:04:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=262s).

## How to de-orbit [(00:04:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=275s)
- De-orbiting a piece of space waste involves grabbing it and pushing it down into Earth's atmosphere where it mostly burns up upon re-entry, a process that is not cheap, with a spacecraft removal mission costing around 100 million euros [(00:04:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=276s).
- The European Space Agency's first actual removal mission will be launched in 2025 by a [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) startup called Clear Space, which has developed a solution that uses a big grappling system to pick up a large piece of debris from orbit [(00:04:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=299s).
- Clear Space's solution involves rendezvousing with the subject at 28,000 kilometers per hour, allowing their speed to match the subject, and then capturing it in an environment with no friction and no gravity [(00:05:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=326s).
- Once the object is captured, it will be stabilized and slowed down to reintroduce it into the Earth's atmosphere in the South Pacific over Point Nemo, where the object will burn out [(00:05:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=341s).
- Professor Giuliamo Alietti from the Surrey Space Center is working on a lower-cost space junk removal concept, which includes a cleanup satellite with a spider-like net to entangle a piece of floating metal [(00:06:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=360s).
- Japan-based startup [Astroscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroscale) is hoping to cut costs by considering the cleanup process from the beginning, and has developed a magnetic arm that can attach to a metal plate on a satellite, making it easier to remove [(00:06:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=385s).
- Astroscale's goal is to see a circular economy in orbit, where satellites are maintained, repaired, and removed after launch, rather than being left to become debris [(00:07:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=421s).
- Astroscale's team, led by Chris Blackaby, believes that all satellites should have some kind of capability to be more easily docked with, to help reduce future debris [(00:06:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=414s).

## Challenges [(00:07:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=436s)
- There is a five-year rule for satellites to be de-orbited after completing their missions, but space guidelines are hard to enforce and there is no authority to ensure compliance [(00:07:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=436s).
- The development of cleanup technologies by one country can be perceived as a potential weapon by another, and examples include broom lasers being developed in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China), and [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) to nudge space junk pieces off a collision course [(00:07:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=451s).
- [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) has been suspected of building a giant laser to blind and damage other satellites from the ground, highlighting the need for regulation to prevent such technologies from being used offensively [(00:07:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=467s).
- Destroying unwanted or defunct satellites with ground missiles has been an environmental disaster for lower [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) orbit, with demonstrations made by the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), China, [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), and Russia, generating massive fields of debris [(00:08:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=495s).
- The impact of these weapons on the [Space environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_environment) is worse than the loss of the satellite itself, and the latest test made by Russia will affect the operations of the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) (ISS) for years [(00:08:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=510s).
- The number of satellites in orbit is set to increase fourfold by 2030, which will rapidly increase the risk posed by space junk, but the technology for removal missions is almost ready, and what is needed is political commitment to fund these missions [(00:08:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=531s).

## Conclusion [(00:09:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=553s)
- To maintain the connected world as it is currently known, governments, businesses, and scientists will need to seriously rethink how they treat the space environment [(00:09:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=555s)
- The issue of space junk and who should be responsible for cleaning it up needs to be considered in order to find the best way to address the problem [(00:09:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM1jDq-8Cxk&t=566s)

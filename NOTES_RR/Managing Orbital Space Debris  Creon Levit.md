## The Solar Cycle and its Effects on Space Debris
- The sun has a seven-year or 14-year cycle, during which it becomes active and inactive, emitting more radiation at certain wavelengths that can affect the upper atmosphere of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), particularly during [Solar flare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare), [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=0s).
- When the sun is active, it increases the density of the upper atmosphere, causing objects in orbit to be dragged down faster due to increased atmospheric density, which can lead to re-entry and burn-up, [(00:00:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=8s).
- The solar cycle and debris re-entries are related, as when the sun is active, more debris re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, providing some natural cleaning, but not enough to solve the problem of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), [(00:00:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=55s).
- To manage space debris, satellites are designed with restricted lifetimes, and operators are required to dispose of them after a certain number of years, either by re-entering the Earth's atmosphere or moving them to an orbit that does not interfere with other satellites, [(00:01:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=69s).
- Some satellites, like those launched by [Planet Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Labs), are designed to have short lifetimes and re-enter the Earth's atmosphere after a few years, while others, like the billion-dollar NVSAT satellite, which is now a large piece of space junk, require more careful planning for disposal, [(00:02:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=120s).

## Managing Space Debris
- Active debris removal is a proposed solution to remove large dead objects from orbit, as they pose a significant threat of collisions and creating more debris, [(00:02:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=175s).
- To avoid collisions, a traffic management system is necessary, similar to air traffic management, to track the location of all satellites and ensure they follow an orderly pattern to minimize the risk of collisions, [(00:03:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=180s).
- The issue of collisions with a dense [Constellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation) of satellites can be mitigated by mapping out their positions in different coordinate systems, allowing for a more organized and efficient use of space [(00:03:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=217s).
- By using mathematical functions to map out the positions of satellites, they can be placed in a grid-like pattern, with each satellite sitting in its own "box", reducing the risk of collisions [(00:03:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=238s).
- The [Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) constellation is an example of this, with satellites that have been launched recently appearing as brightly colored dots, and those that have reached their assigned orbits appearing as pale gray dots [(00:04:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=273s).
- As satellites reach their assigned positions, they slow down and lock into their position, turning gray, and can be seen building up a grid-like pattern [(00:05:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=323s).
- If all satellites stay in their assigned positions, or "boxes", the risk of collisions can be greatly reduced, and a large number of satellites can be safely operated in orbit [(00:05:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=335s).

## Collision Avoidance and Traffic Management
- However, the presence of debris objects that do not follow the same rules and can interfere with operational satellites is a significant challenge [(00:05:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=357s).
- Active debris removal is one possible solution, which could involve using robots or other technologies to capture and remove debris objects from orbit [(00:06:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=368s).
- Satellite servicing and debris removal are similar in that they require proximity to the target object, attachment, and then some form of action, such as refueling or moving the object to a graveyard orbit [(00:06:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=385s).
- One of the challenges of debris removal is that debris objects are often tumbling, making it harder to get a hold of them, and new technologies, such as inflatable balloons, are being proposed as potential solutions [(00:06:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=408s).
- The idea of sending up a net to collect [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) is not feasible because it can create more problems, such as the net getting tangled up with other objects and causing even more debris, or accidentally hitting and damaging other satellites [(00:07:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=425s).
- Schemes like using a net to collect space debris can also be considered as anti-satellite weapons in disguise, as they could potentially be used to remove or disable other satellites [(00:07:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=449s).

## Active Debris Removal and Proposed Solutions
- Another proposed method for removing space debris is using harpoons to catch and drag away the debris, which was considered in a European space mission called e.Deorbit [(00:07:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=473s).
- The e.Deorbit mission was planned to use a satellite to grab a dead environmental satellite, called [Envisat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envisat), and de-boost it into the atmosphere, but the mission was cancelled [(00:07:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=479s).
- Despite the cancellation of the e.Deorbit mission, a new mission called [ClearSpace-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearSpace-1) is scheduled to launch in 2025, which aims to remove a medium-sized piece of junk from orbit at a cost of 86 million euros [(00:08:33)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=513s).
- The Envisat satellite, which was supposed to be removed by the e.Deorbit mission, is still in orbit, and the ClearSpace mission will target a different piece of debris [(00:08:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvHzI3C0ow&t=510s).

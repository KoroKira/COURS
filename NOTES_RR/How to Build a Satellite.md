## Introduction
- Satellites are essential tools in the modern world, facilitating global communication, gathering scientific data, and exploring the cosmos and other planets in the solar system [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=0s).
- A satellite can be thought of as two separate systems: the payload and the bus, with the payload being the equipment used to carry out the mission and the bus being everything else [(00:00:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=37s).
- The payload varies depending on the mission, such as cameras and radar equipment for an [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) observation mission, transponders and high-gain antennas for a communications mission, and probes and sensors for a scientific research mission [(00:00:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=43s).
- Satellites come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, from micro satellites weighing under 100 kg to large satellites weighing over 1,000 kg, and pico satellites weighing less than 1 kg [(00:01:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=76s).

## The CubeSat
- The nano satellite category includes the [CubeSat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat), a standardized cube-shaped unit called 1U, which is designed to be modular and low-cost, and can scale up to 3U, 6U, and 12U sizes [(00:01:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=97s).

## Satellite Subsystems
- Regardless of size, the bus of a satellite usually has seven fundamental subsystems: mechanical structure, onboard computer, [Electric power system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_system), attitude determination and control system, propulsion system, communication system, and [Spacecraft thermal control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_thermal_control) [(00:02:15)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=135s).

## Mechanical Structure
- The mechanical structure needs to be strong and stiff to survive launch, but also as light as possible to save on launch costs, and engineers use smart design, thorough analysis, and careful material selection to achieve this [(00:02:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=155s).
- Materials used in satellites need to have good stiffness and strength properties relative to their weight, and must be checked for outgassing, where the vacuum of space causes materials to release gases trapped within them [(00:02:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=173s).
- A process called bakeout can be used to reduce the risk of outgassing, where the flight hardware is heated under vacuum conditions to accelerate outgassing before integration into the satellite [(00:03:46)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=226s).
- The satellite structure includes a separation system that attaches to the launch vehicle adapter, and deployable mechanisms are often used for solar panels, instrument booms, and antennas to get around the limited volume allocated to the satellite in the fairing of the launch vehicle [(00:04:04)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=244s).

## Onboard Computer
- At the core of every satellite is the onboard computer, which controls and coordinates all the satellite's functions, including the payload [(00:04:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=272s).
- A satellite's onboard computer manages the [Electric power system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_system), which generates, stores, and distributes power to operate the satellite, and is typically built around several printed circuit boards housed in an aluminum alloy enclosure [(00:04:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=287s).
- One major challenge with putting electronics in space is their exposure to cosmic radiation, which can penetrate the satellite's structure, disrupt circuits, and lead to system failure, particularly affecting the onboard computer [(00:04:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=297s).
- To mitigate this, engineers often use radiation-hardened components and shield sensitive parts or the whole device with layers of thick aluminum [(00:05:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=331s).

## Electrical Power System
- The onboard computer manages the electrical power system, which generates power through solar arrays, the most common method of generating power for satellites [(00:06:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=360s).
- A 1 square meter area directly facing the sun just above Earth's atmosphere will receive 1.3 kW of solar power, making solar arrays an efficient method of generating power [(00:05:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=354s).
- Satellites use multi-junction solar cells constructed from multiple layers of different semiconductor materials, which capture a wider range of wavelengths than single-junction cells, making them more efficient [(00:06:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=391s).
- Satellites experience periods of eclipse when in Earth's shadow, where solar arrays are unable to generate power, and need to carry batteries charged by solar panels during periods of exposure to sunlight [(00:06:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=407s).
- The [Electric power system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_system) is controlled by the satellite's power control unit, which interfaces with the onboard computer, monitors the charge level of the batteries, controls charging and discharging, and regulates voltage to ensure a stable power supply [(00:07:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=425s).

## Attitude Determination and Control System
- The attitude determination and control system determines and adjusts the satellite's orientation relative to a reference frame, which is crucial for normal operation, including pointing the payload, solar panels, and antenna [(00:07:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=447s).
- The attitude determination and control system uses sensors to determine the current satellite attitude and actuators to make necessary adjustments, with the strategy selected based on the pointing requirements of the mission and the size of the satellite [(00:08:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=502s).
- Satellites often carry an inertial measurement unit that contains gyroscopes and accelerometers, which provide a continuous measure of any changes in satellite orientation, but require additional sensors to obtain good pointing knowledge [(00:08:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=531s).
- Attitude determination combines gyroscope measurements with data from star trackers, which provide highly accurate reference measurements of the satellite attitude to periodically correct the continuous attitude measurement provided by the gyroscopes [(00:09:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=559s).
- Star trackers are cameras that capture an image of the sky, use an algorithm to identify bright stars, and compare their position in the image with a catalog of known stars to determine the satellite's orientation [(00:09:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=585s).
- Star trackers can be very accurate but may not work well if pointed close to the Sun or if the satellite is spinning too fast relative to the camera shutter speed, and options for accommodating them on the satellite are limited [(00:10:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=602s).
- Engineers designing the system need to take into account the limitations of star trackers and select attitude sensors based on the mission requirements, with alternatives including sun sensors or magnetometers [(00:10:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=627s).
- Sun sensors are simple devices that use photo detector cells to estimate the attitude of the satellite relative to the Sun, but they don't work during the eclipse portion of an orbit [(00:10:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=638s).
- Magnetometers measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field surrounding the satellite, comparing the measurements with a model of the expected magnetic field of the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) to estimate its attitude [(00:10:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=653s).
- Most modern satellites use three-axis stabilization for attitude control, where actuators are used to precisely control satellite orientation around three axes [(00:11:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=678s).
- Reaction wheels are a common actuator, consisting of a flywheel attached to an electric motor, which causes the satellite to rotate about its center of mass in the opposite direction when the motor changes the rotational velocity of the reaction wheel [(00:11:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=692s).
- A minimum of three reaction wheels mounted in orthogonal planes give the satellite full three-axis control, allowing minute adjustments to be made to the satellite attitude [(00:11:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=708s).
- Reaction wheels can become saturated after a certain number of attitude adjustments, requiring alternative methods for attitude control, such as magnetorquers [(00:12:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=720s).
- Magnetorquers are coils of conductive wire wound around a magnetic core, creating a magnetic field that interacts with Earth's magnetic field to generate a torque for attitude control or desaturating reaction wheels [(00:12:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=750s).
- Magnetorquers are reliable due to having no moving parts but only work in relatively low orbits where the Earth's magnetic field is sufficiently strong [(00:12:54)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=774s).

## Propulsion System
- Another option for attitude control is using the propulsion system to fire thrusters, with common methods of propulsion including cold gas propulsion, chemical propulsion, and electric propulsion [(00:13:05)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=785s).
- The principle thrust is generated by accelerating mass through a nozzle, with the simplest form of propulsion being the cold gas thruster, which is the controlled expansion of a stored pressurized gas through thruster nozzles [(00:13:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=817s).
- Higher thrust can be generated with chemical propulsion, which uses a controlled chemical reaction in a monopropellant system, where the propellant is a liquid that decomposes into a hot gas when it comes into contact with a catalyst [(00:14:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=849s).
- Bipropellant systems use two propellants, a fuel and an oxidizer, which are mixed and ignited in a combustion chamber, producing exhaust gases that are expelled through the nozzle to generate thrust [(00:14:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=877s).
- Electric propulsion uses electrical energy to generate thrust by ionizing a propellant, often a gas like [Xenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenon), and then using electric and magnetic fields to accelerate the ions to high velocities before expelling them through a nozzle [(00:14:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=895s).
- The propulsion system is selected based on the thrust requirements and the mass of the satellite, with by propellent systems being complex but offering high thrust, useful for large satellites [(00:15:16)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=916s).
- Monopropellant systems have lower thrust but simpler system design, electric propulsion has lower thrust than the chemical propulsion options but is very efficient, requiring less propellant, and cold gas thrusters offer low thrust but very simple design and precise control [(00:15:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=927s).

## Communication System
- The communication system is of vital importance, with two separate capabilities: downlink and telemetry, tracking, and command, used to beam data generated by the payload down to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) [(00:15:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=958s).
- Satellites transmit information to ground stations using electromagnetic waves, characterized by their wavelength and frequency, with satellite communications using electromagnetic waves in the radio frequency or RF part of the spectrum [(00:16:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=997s).
- The data transmitted from a satellite is essentially a stream of bits, which can have a value of either one or zero, and needs to be encoded onto a carrier signal, a continuous sinusoidal electromagnetic wave, using modulation [(00:17:29)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1049s).
- Modulation can be done by changing certain properties of the carrier wave, such as amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, or phase shift keying, with most high-rate communication links using one of the several forms of phase shift keying [(00:17:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1077s).
- Satellites use modulation to provide high data throughput and low error rates, with the modulated signal generated on board by the transmitter hardware, routed through switches and filters, and transmitted to the ground station via the downlink antenna [(00:18:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1107s).
- The Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C) subsystem consists of a transceiver and various filters, switches, and antennas, and uses clever engineering to fulfill its three functions: command, telemetry, and tracking [(00:19:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1141s).
- The command function allows the operations team to control the satellite by transmitting commands from the ground station, which are demodulated by the TT&C hardware and routed to the onboard computer for implementation [(00:19:19)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1159s).
- The telemetry function transmits housekeeping data from various sensors on the satellite down to the ground station, including temperature, power levels, and propellant levels [(00:19:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1176s).
- The tracking function provides information about the position and speed of the satellite by sending a signal to the satellite, which the transceiver receives and sends back, providing an estimate of the distance and velocity of the satellite [(00:19:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1190s).
- GPS receivers can be used to enhance tracking capabilities, allowing for more effective monitoring of position and trajectory, although this is not an option for all orbits [(00:20:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1224s).
- Antennas used to transmit and receive RF signals are a fundamental part of any communication system, and come in many different shapes and sizes [(00:20:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1237s).
- The performance of antennas can be compared by thinking about a theoretical isotropic antenna that radiates power uniformly in all directions, with real antennas engineered to focus or receive energy in specific directions [(00:20:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1247s).
- The directionality of an antenna can be visualized as a radiation pattern, and is quantified by a parameter called gain, which measures how much an antenna focuses energy in a particular direction [(00:21:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1287s).
- The antennas on a satellite are selected to optimize performance for a specific task, with downlink systems using high-gain antennas to focus the transmitted signal into a narrow beam, and TT&C systems using low-gain antennas with wider coverage to prioritize reliable communications [(00:21:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1318s).

## Thermal Control System
- Satellites face extreme temperature fluctuations in space, with surfaces exposed to direct sunlight reaching extremely high temperatures, while temperatures suddenly drop when the satellite enters Earth's shadow, making thermal control a huge challenge [(00:22:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1373s).
- Thermal control is mission-critical, as some parts of the payload need to be kept within narrow temperature ranges to function as intended, and batteries or electrical components that exceed their allowable temperature limits are at risk of failure [(00:23:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1398s).
- Thermal control systems use various technologies and engineering techniques to maintain stable temperatures, as there is no heat transfer by convection in the vacuum of space, and the only way for the satellite to exchange thermal energy with the environment is by radiation [(00:23:39)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1419s).
- Radiators with high emissivity coatings are used to radiate heat from the satellite, while heat pipes transport thermal energy from hot to cold areas, and thermostat-controlled electric heaters switch on at low temperatures to prevent components from getting too cold [(00:23:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1429s).
- Multi-layer insulation blankets help control temperature by reflecting solar radiation when the satellite is in sunlight and reducing radiative heat losses when the satellite is in shadow [(00:24:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1449s).
- Special paints and coatings, as well as phase change materials, absorb or release thermal energy by undergoing a phase change, and the attitude control system can contribute to thermal control by changing the direction radiators and other surfaces are facing [(00:24:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1460s).
- All these components need to work in harmony to perfectly balance absorbing, retaining, and dissipating heat to keep the satellite's temperature within acceptable ranges [(00:24:36)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1476s).

## Onshape
- Having access to the right design tools is important for designing hardware destined for orbit or working on experimental projects, and [Onshape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onshape) is a powerful cloud-based CAD platform that makes it quick and easy to bring designs to life [(00:25:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1512s).
- Onshape features a user-friendly interface, intuitive tools, detailed version tracking, standard part libraries, and collaborative tools that allow multiple people to work on the same assembly at the same time [(00:25:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1527s).
- Onshape also provides access to public files from other users, which is a great way to learn, and offers loads of useful training material to help users get up to speed [(00:26:07)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1567s).

## Promotion
- The video offers a promotion of 6 months for free [(00:26:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5voQfQOTem8&t=1609s).

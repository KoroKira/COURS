## Intro [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=0s)
- The [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) is currently orbited by more than 160 million man-made pieces of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), consisting of materials such as steel, aluminium, and paint chips, traveling at 23 times faster than the speed of sound [(00:00:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=0s).
- If space debris continues to accumulate, it could lead to the creation of a Kessler effect, which is a continuously colliding debris field that would make it impossible for satellites to survive and spaceships to escape, potentially trapping humans on Earth [(00:00:11)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=11s).
- The increasing amount of space debris poses a significant threat to space exploration and satellite technology, highlighting the need for effective solutions to address this issue [(00:00:13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=13s).
- Four potential methods for capturing space debris are being explored, aiming to mitigate the risks associated with the growing amount of space trash and prevent a catastrophic scenario [(00:00:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=23s).

## Overview [(00:00:35)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=35s)
- Humans have made significant progress in space travel over the past 50 years, including putting a man on the moon, building permanent [Space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station), and creating a network of satellites that are vital to many terrestrial technologies and economies [(00:00:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=42s).
- The accumulation of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) has become a major issue, with over 23,000 pieces of debris larger than a baseball and approximately 500,000 pieces the size of a marble currently in orbit, according to [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) and the [United States Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense) [(00:01:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=66s).
- Space debris poses a significant threat to spacecraft and satellites, as even small pieces of debris can cause significant damage due to their high speeds of up to 20 kilometers per second [(00:01:23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=83s).
- The problem of space debris is exacerbated by events such as China's 2007 test of an anti-satellite missile, which added over 3,500 pieces of trackable debris to Earth's orbit [(00:01:47)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=107s).
- If left unchecked, the amount of space debris could lead to a catastrophic event known as the [Kessler syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome), where collisions between debris create a runaway cycle of collisions, making space inhospitable to satellites and untraversable by spacecraft [(00:02:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=126s).
- One of the major challenges in cleaning up space debris is developing a method to dock with or capture the debris, which is often tumbling and rotating rapidly, making it difficult to map a suitable approach vector [(00:02:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=144s).
- The industry of removing space debris is estimated to be worth approximately $1.4 billion by 2028, and finding effective solutions to this problem is crucial to preventing a "space prison" and ensuring the continued use of space for scientific and economic purposes [(00:02:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=162s).

## Claw Capture [(00:02:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=171s)
- Clear Space, a Swiss-based startup that spun out from the [ETH Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich) in 2019, has developed a claw capture technology to retrieve [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), and has already secured an 86 million euro contract with the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) to launch their proof of concept mission [(00:02:51)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=171s).
- The Clear Space 1 spacecraft will feature a conventional chemical rocket-powered system with a purpose-built four-armed claw that will match the orbiting trajectory of a target before extending its arms and grasping onto it, with its maiden mission due to launch in 2025 targeting a [Vespa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespa), a Vega secondary payload adapter [(00:02:53)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=173s).
- Once the spacecraft has acquired the target object, it will vector so that it re-enters the atmosphere, causing both the spacecraft and the payload to burn up on re-entry, with a key advantage of this system being that it targets large debris objects, removing them from orbit before a collision turns them into many smaller pieces of debris [(00:02:56)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=176s).
- The mechanical capture of a target requires careful matching of velocities and tumbling behavior to prevent further debris generation, and the claw system sets an upper and lower size limit on the objects that can be captured, with Clear Space being selected by the [UK Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Space_Agency) to define a space mission able to remove multiple defunct satellites from orbit as of October 27, 2021 [(00:02:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=177s).
- The UK Space Agency's initiative is driving development in two critical areas needed for commercially viable debris removal: multi-removal missions and refueling, with Clear Space's technology being a key part of this effort [(00:03:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=182s).
- The Clear Space 1 mission will demonstrate the effectiveness of the claw capture technology in removing large debris objects from orbit, and will help to pave the way for future debris removal missions [(00:03:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=189s).

## Magnetic Capture [(00:04:30)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=270s)
- [Astroscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroscale), a [Japanese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language) company, is developing a magnetic tugboat debris capture system that aims to match the orbit trajectory of a satellite or debris candidate and magnetically dock to either complete repairs on a satellite or push the debris into the atmosphere so it burns up [(00:04:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=272s).
- The company proposes that all satellites can be pre-engineered with a lightweight magnetic docking plate to make the capture process more reliable, which would enable easy docking with minimal chance of damaging or creating further debris, although this system may not be as effective for collecting existing objects without these plates [(00:04:34)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=274s).
- Astroscale successfully demonstrated its capability to capture a client object in a trial run through the End-of-Life Services by Astroscale demonstration mission on August 25, 2021, which showed the potential of the magnetic capture system [(00:04:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=278s).
- As of October 26, 2021, Astroscale Limited, the UK subsidiary of Astroscale, was awarded a [UK Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Space_Agency) bid to study the removal of two further defunct satellites from space as part of their Cosmic programme, which involves cleaning out space through innovative capture methods [(00:04:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=280s).
- The magnetic capture system has the potential to be used for both repairing satellites and removing debris from space, with the goal of reducing the amount of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) in orbit and preventing further collisions [(00:04:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=282s).
- The use of magnetic docking plates would allow for a more efficient and safe capture process, reducing the risk of damage to the satellite or the capture system, and minimizing the creation of further debris [(00:04:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=284s).

## Remove Debris [(00:05:37)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=337s)
- The [RemoveDEBRIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RemoveDEBRIS) project, pioneered by [Surrey Satellite Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_Satellite_Technology), is a space debris removal approach that utilizes a tethered harpoon and a weighted net casting system, designed by [Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus), to capture debris in space [(00:05:40)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=340s).
- The Remove Debris system features a net system that can capture targets, such as a cubesat, which is a common type of small satellite, by firing a space net that wraps around and entangles the target, and then reels it in using a motor-driven winch [(00:06:01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=361s).
- The project also includes a harpoon system, which consists of a 1.5 meter boom that deploys from the satellite platform, firing a special purpose-made harpoon at 20 meters per second to penetrate the target and lock it in place via a tether attached to the spacecraft [(00:06:27)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=387s).
- The key advantages of the Remove Debris systems, including the net and harpoon, are that they are capable of capturing very large pieces of debris without having to match the tumbling properties of the debris object, although they risk small pieces of debris separating from the larger structure [(00:06:42)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=402s).

## Laser Broom [(00:06:57)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=417s)
- The laser broom is a method for capturing [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris), with companies like Electro-Orbit Systems (EOS), an [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) company, having experience in developing laser systems for use in the aviation and defense industries [(00:06:58)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=418s).
- High energy laser pulse radiation may be the most feasible means to mitigate the threat of a collision with a [Space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station) or other high-value space asset with orbital debris in the sizes of 1 to 10 centimeters [(00:07:10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=430s).
- Under laser irradiation, part of the debris material is ablated or heated, providing an impulse to the debris particle, which can either deflect the object's trajectory away from the high-value asset or slow the debris into an intercept course with the upper atmosphere where it ultimately burns up [(00:07:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=444s).
- The idea would be that this laser system would scan across the sky systematically, removing debris targets out of the trajectory of high-value space assets, with most research concentrating on ground-based laser systems [(00:07:44)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=464s).
- Ground-based laser systems are preferred over arming satellites with laser systems, as the latter is generally seen as militarizing space, but ground-mounted approaches have to deal with atmospheric distortions that may make reliably targeting small objects difficult [(00:07:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=472s).
- This system could be used quickly to target many pieces of debris, servicing multiple objects much more quickly than physically capturing them ever could, and having some control over where the debris lands is probably preferable [(00:08:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=489s).
- Technically, all objects orbiting the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) will crash back down through the atmosphere given enough time, but having some control over the process is critical to explore space in a sustainable way and prevent the debris from building up [(00:08:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIeRpePrWN8&t=500s).

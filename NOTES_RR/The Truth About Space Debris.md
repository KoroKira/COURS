## The Growing Problem of Space Debris
- [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) conducted its first successful anti-satellite test on March 27th, 2019, by launching a three-stage missile that intercepted and shattered its military satellite, [Microsat-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsat-R), into hundreds of pieces, contributing to the growing [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) problem [(00:00:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=12s).
- The test was universally condemned as a completely unnecessary political posturing move that added significantly to Earth's space debris problem, with the probability of collisions occurring continually rising, and several collision events having already damaged the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) and other high-value satellites [(00:00:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=50s).
- Every launch into space generates unwanted waste, including solid-fuel rockets depositing aluminium-oxide particles, explosive bolts fragmenting into pieces, and even chips of paint causing issues, such as the 1983 incident where a 0.2 mm chip of paint gouged a pit out of one of the Challenger space shuttle's windows [(00:01:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=80s).
- Post-mission analysis of the Space Shuttle launches found that 177 impacts were caused by space debris, with 44% being caused by aluminium alloys, 37% by paint chips, 12% by steel, 5% by copper, and 2% by titanium, resulting in significant damage and costly repairs [(00:01:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=108s).

## The Increasing Likelihood of Collisions
- The likelihood of a collision between a satellite in low [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) orbit and a piece of debris over 1 centimeter in size has increased over time, from 17-20% in 2007 to 25-33% later that year, and to 50% by 2010, after the collision between [Iridium 33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_33) and [Kosmos 2251](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_2251) satellites [(00:02:22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=142s).
- The chances of collision are not small, and it is only a matter of time before another serious incident occurs, making it prudent to design satellites to withstand small impacts and dodge larger ones, such as the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station), which can withstand objects up to 1 centimeter in size and dodge larger trackable objects [(00:03:21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=201s).
- The biggest danger to the occupants of the International [Space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station) are objects between 1-10 centimeters in size that are untrackable but large enough to cause serious damage, and [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) has laid out a basic risk management policy to minimize this risk, aiming for a probability of less than 19% over 10 years [(00:03:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=230s).

## Protecting the International Space Station
- [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) is a constant risk that astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) need to be aware of, with a constant undercurrent awareness of the risk of something hitting the spaceship and causing a leak [(00:04:43)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=283s).
- The ISS uses a multilayer shielding system, known as a [Whipple shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipple_shield), which takes advantage of the debris' own velocity to stop it by creating a shield composed of several thin sheets of armor separated by space [(00:06:32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=392s).
- The Whipple shield is an elegant and efficient solution, as using heavy plates for shielding, like those used on tanks on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), would be too heavy and expensive, with a 1 meter squared aluminum plate weighing around 338 kilograms and costing around $31.5 million to launch [(00:05:59)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=359s).
- The Whipple shield works by breaking up the projectile into thousands of smaller superheated fragments, spreading the energy of the impact over a larger area, and has been tested by the [European Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency), which found that it can protect against small debris [(00:06:45)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=405s).
- Astronauts, such as former [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) commander [Chris Hadfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hadfield), are occasionally reminded of the space debris problem, and have to be careful not to cut their suits while on space walks on sharp impact edges, with some even reporting hearing the sound of small debris hitting the ship [(00:07:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=446s).
- The Whipple shield is only effective for smaller debris, and larger particles would tear right through it, highlighting the need for continued research and development of shielding technologies [(00:08:08)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=488s).

## Managing the Risk of Space Debris
- The risk of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) is managed through a combination of shielding, procedures, and understanding the statistics of the risk, including the relative risk of man-made debris versus naturally occurring debris [(00:05:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=306s).
- The International [Space station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station) (ISS) and other satellites have to dodge incoming space debris, with ground-based radar systems like the Haystack Radar providing spatial data on the debris, which includes information on size, speed, and direction [(00:08:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=500s).
- The data from the radar system is fed into a database that allows [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) and other space agencies to predict potential collisions and plan maneuvers to avoid them, with the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) having an exclusion zone of 50 kilometers squared and 0.75 kilometers deep around it [(00:08:25)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=505s).
- If the risk of collision is between one in ten thousand and one in one hundred thousand, the ISS receives a yellow warning, and flight controllers must perform avoidance maneuvers if they do not interfere with mission objectives [(00:09:20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=560s).
- In cases where the risk of collision is greater than one in ten thousand, a red warning is received, and the ISS must take action, which can include using control momentum gyros to alter its orientation or thrusters to provide acceleration [(00:09:41)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=581s).

## The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope Incident
- The [Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_Gamma-ray_Space_Telescope) received an automated email alert in 2012 about a predicted incursion with a retired Russian spy satellite, [Kosmos 1805](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1805), and performed a 1-second burn to separate the two satellites [(00:10:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=624s).

## The Future of Space Debris and its Management
- The issue of [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) is expected to grow as human activities in space increase, and it is essential to think more seriously about managing the cosmic neighborhood, with mainstream media often being alarmist about the issue [(00:11:18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=678s).
- Despite the concerns, space debris does not pose an immediate threat to space travel, and most debris is too small to see, with massive debris like the upper stage of Apollo 12's [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V) rocket being easy to dodge [(00:11:49)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=709s).
- A significant amount of debris from India's anti-satellite test will have drifted back to [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth), similar to the US's [Operation Burnt Frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Burnt_Frost) in 2008, which had similar orbits and altitudes, with the majority of debris falling back to earth within 2 months [(00:12:17)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=737s).
- The larger trackable debris from Operation Burnt Frost took around 2 years to return to earth, while smaller debris decays faster due to a larger area to mass ratio, making them more sensitive to atmospheric drag [(00:12:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=758s).
- Even in orbit, molecules collide with satellites and debris, causing them to lose altitude, and this natural process is not a reason to ignore the problem of space debris [(00:13:00)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=780s).
- The potential loss of money from damaging collisions and the potential chain reaction in a busy earth orbit will motivate efforts to fix the problem, as entire economies have been built upon the services provided by satellites [(00:13:12)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=792s).
- International treaties dictating space operations need to be updated to mitigate the issue, requiring satellites to be capable of bringing themselves out of orbit and dodging debris when needed [(00:13:31)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=811s).
- Active clearance may be needed to keep [Space debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) at a reasonable level, and launching more objects into orbit to solve the problem is not a viable solution, as it will add to the space debris problem [(00:13:55)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=835s).

## Potential Solutions and International Cooperation
- A more promising technology involves using high power lasers to ablate material from debris, providing thrust to slow its orbit and increase its rate of decay, but this technology raises concerns about its potential use as an anti-satellite weapon [(00:14:24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=864s).
- International cooperation is necessary to address the issue of space debris, and it can become a uniting problem for space-faring nations, just like the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) became an international effort to unite mankind [(00:14:48)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itdYS9XF4a0&t=888s).

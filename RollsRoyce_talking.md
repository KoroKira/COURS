Before i begin to talk about anything, i need to explain some interesting things and some necessary things.
At first, let me tell you a little bit more about myself. Im a young student from ICAM, and since my childhood, i always had my thoughts filled about space, planets, stars and everything else. That's why, years later, to be more precise, now, i am currently working in the aerospace industry, to be more precise, at Thales Alenia Space. I know it could seems cool and incredible, but i am just a fullstack developper, nothing too fancy about satellites to be honest, because im more of a software guy. But, i have always been interested in the satellite and the stars, that's why when i had the opportunity to work for a company that is specialized in the aerospace industry, i took it. I know it's too bad: this event is sponsored by Airbus and it would have been cooler if i was from Defense & Space, but yeah, i guess maybe soon, if the company merging happen ahah.
But anyway, i should go back to the original topic ! If i am here, it's to talk about the satellite waste, and how does the company manage the whole lifecycle of a satellite. 

It's a very important subject in our times, because the space is getting more and more crowded, and the satellites are getting more and more numerous. There is some good companies who, since the early 2000, were already thinking about this future problems, and they have already started to work on it also. I have looked it, and found some trace of this concept, of "overcrowded space", to appear very early in the space race.

The earliest source of concern about "overcrowding space" can be traced back to 1961, just four years after the launch of Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite.
In 1961, E. E. Peterkin of the Operational Research Branch, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, published the first of two memoranda on satellite collisions1. The first memorandum, titled "Some Characteristics of the Artificial Earth Satellite Population," predicted that the catalogued population of objects in space would grow by 318 objects per year1.
It's worth noting that while Peterkin's work in 1961 marks the earliest formal recognition of this issue, the problem of space debris and overcrowding has since grown significantly, leading to more recent developments such as the Kessler syndrome proposed by NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler in 1978.
To put some datas in perspective, i'd like to ask you a quick question: how many satellite are there, above us ?

From SatelliteTracker3D, I found that there was about 25 000 satellites above us, debris and not debris. And from Orbit.ing.org, there is 11 884 Objects that are above us and active (INFORMATION A VERIFIER). So, with some quick math, there is about 13 116 satellites who are dead, but still above us, in space. That's a lot of satellites, but those numbers are difficult to understand, because they are way to big. So, let's imagine something... Let's imagine all of those satellites are up in space after a full year, like, from 0 to 25 000. It would mean that we would have to send a bit more than 68 satellites each day to space. It's massive. And in this parallel universe, where there is a bit more than 68 satellites sent everyday to space, it would mean that after 173 days, we will cease to send working satellites. 173 days, it's not even a year. It's not even a full year, and we would have already sent all of the satellites that are above us. It's a lot of satellites, and it's a lot of waste. And that's why, it's important to talk about the satellite waste, and how does the company manage the whole lifecycle of a satellite.
 
But before i begin, i would like to ask you a question: do you know how a satellite dies? I know it could seems like a weird question, but it's a very interesting one. So, let me explain to you how a satellite dies.

A satellite dies when it runs out of fuel, or when it is no longer able to maintain its orbit. This can happen for a number of reasons, including mechanical failure, damage from space debris, or simply reaching the end of its operational life. Usually, big companies are setting up some values to determine the end of the satellite life, and when it's time to retire it. From what i know, at TAS, we are at about 20-ish year before the quality of the satellite is not good enough for our quality standards, even if it would still be working and usable after. For other companies such as Starlink, it's... more sad. Their life expectancy is of 5 years. And during those 5 years, specialist have seen that the quality is, firstly, very cheap, and secondly, quickly decreasing. That's something that we have to keep in mind: the quality of the satellite is very important, and it's something that we have to keep in mind when we are talking about the satellite waste, and how does the company manage the whole lifecycle of a satellite, and that it's not all of the satellite company that are doing the same quality and life expectancy. 

This difference of life expectancy is easy to explain: we, in the old continent, are building some great master work, it's a work of art, personalized for each mission. Each satellite is unique, and is "handmade" at each step by the specialist. That's another thing important to keep in mind about the price also. The price is justified by the quality of the satellite. In the new continent, with all the new companies, in China, or in the USA, with Starlink especially, we can see that they are basically sending cheap space garbage, in great quantities, so that if it's not working, it's not a big deal, they have 1000 others. It's a very different way of thinking, and it's a very different way of working. It's more industrialized, bad and they try to seek to make it the cheapest way possible, without even thinking about the afterlife of the satellite.

When a satellite is judged as dead so, they need to be treated. There is 3 big ways currently for it: either they are sent back to earth to be destroyed by the entrance in the atmosphere, either they are sent to the "graveyard orbit", or either they are just... well, staying there. 

The first case is not that good for some reason, especially because it's putting some toxic heavy metals in the atmosphere, destroying the ozone layers. For the Starlink satellites, it have been found that currently, musk satellites are raining out of orbit at a rate of 120 per month and each one produce 30 kg of aluminium oxide which eat away at the ozone layer and these oxides have increased 8 folds in the atmosphere since 2016. Just this information is catastrophic, and it's just about Starlink satellites ! So if we are thinking of all of them... it's sure that satellite are dealing some heavy and unprecedented damage to the ozone layers.
For the second case, which is to be sent to the graveyard orbit, even if it seems like a good idea, it's not that good also. The graveyard orbit is a region of space that is far enough away from Earth that it is unlikely to interfere with active satellites or other space missions. However, it is not a permanent solution, as this orbit will be soon overcrowded and causing more damage than it's supposed to prevent. 
The third case, well, is bad because the satellite is not managed or anything, and it just become a dangerous space debris, staying here until something happen. It's not a good solution, and it's not a solution at all, because it's just doing nothing.

The big satellite companies, are currently targetting the second solution. So they are keeping some more propulsion energy in the satellite, so, when it's time, the satellite can be sent to the graveyard orbit.


This solution is not optimal as we can already guess. There is not a single good and optimal solution for now, and the problem of space debris is, and will be, always growing more and more. That's why i think it's now time to speak about the new technologies and system that are put in place to be more eco-friendly with all of our space waste. 

TAS and Airbus especially, are pioneering on this domain, as they are the first of the space giant to develop some concept solution, and trying them in space, with great success.
There is some new technologies that are currently being developed, and that are very promising. For example, there is the new concept of "space sweeper", which is a satellite that is designed to collect and remove space debris from orbit. This satellite is equipped with a robotic arm that can capture and de-orbit debris, reducing the risk of collisions with active satellites. This technology is still in the early stages of development, but it shows great promise for the future of space debris mitigation.
There is also some concept of "space net", which is a large net that can be deployed to capture and remove debris from orbit. This technology is also in the early stages of development, but it has the potential to be a cost-effective and efficient solution for cleaning up space debris.
Another concept, is simple: what if, we send something to just, destroy the satellite ? It's a very simple concept, but it's very effective. It's like a missile, but in space, and it's just to destroy the satellite. It's a very effective way to destroy the satellite, but it's not a very eco-friendly way to do it. But it's a solution, and it's a solution that is currently being used by some companies, especially the new ones, who are sending cheap satellites to space, and who are not thinking about the afterlife of the satellite.
Finally, there is the concept of "space harpoon", which is a device that can be used to capture and remove debris from orbit. This technology is still in the early stages of development, but it shows great promise for the future of space debris mitigation.

In conclusion, the problem of space debris is a growing concern for the aerospace industry, and it is important to develop new technologies and systems to mitigate this issue. The satellite waste is a very important subject, and it is important to understand how the company manage the whole lifecycle of a satellite. There is no single solution to this problem, but there are promising technologies that are being developed to address this issue. It is important to continue to research and develop new technologies to ensure the sustainability of space exploration and satellite operations.
